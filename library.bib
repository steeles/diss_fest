abstract = {The ability to detect and track relevant acoustic signals embedded in a background of other sounds is crucial for hearing in complex acoustic environments. This ability is exemplified by a perceptual phenomenon known as "rhythmic masking release" (RMR). To demonstrate RMR, a sequence of tones forming a target rhythm is intermingled with physically identical "Distracter" sounds that perceptually mask the rhythm. The rhythm can be "released from masking" by adding "Flanker" tones in adjacent frequency channels that are synchronous with the Distracters. RMR represents a special case of auditory stream segregation, whereby the target rhythm is perceptually segregated from the background of Distracters when they are accompanied by the synchronous Flankers. The neural basis of RMR is unknown. Previous studies suggest the involvement of primary auditory cortex (A1) in the perceptual organization of sound patterns. Here, we recorded neural responses to RMR sequences in A1 of awake monkeys in order to identify neural correlates and potential mechanisms of RMR. We also tested whether two current models of stream segregation, when applied to these responses, could account for the perceptual organization of RMR sequences. Results suggest a key role for suppression of Distracter-evoked responses by the simultaneous Flankers in the perceptual restoration of the target rhythm in RMR. Furthermore, predictions of stream segregation models paralleled the psychoacoustics of RMR in humans. These findings reinforce the view that preattentive or "primitive" aspects of auditory scene analysis may be explained by relatively basic neural mechanisms at the cortical level.},

@article{Ulanovsky2004,
abstract = {Neurons in primary auditory cortex (A1) of cats show strong stimulus-specific adaptation (SSA). In probabilistic settings, in which one stimulus is common and another is rare, responses to common sounds adapt more strongly than responses to rare sounds. This SSA could be a correlate of auditory sensory memory at the level of single A1 neurons. Here we studied adaptation in A1 neurons, using three different probabilistic designs. We showed that SSA has several time scales concurrently, spanning many orders of magnitude, from hundreds of milliseconds to tens of seconds. Similar time scales are known for the auditory memory span of humans, as measured both psychophysically and using evoked potentials. A simple model, with linear dependence on both short-term and long-term stimulus history, provided a good fit to A1 responses. Auditory thalamus neurons did not show SSA, and their responses were poorly fitted by the same model. In addition, SSA increased the proportion of failures in the responses of A1 neurons to the adapting stimulus. Finally, SSA caused a bias in the neuronal responses to unbiased stimuli, enhancing the responses to eccentric stimuli. Therefore, we propose that a major function of SSA in A1 neurons is to encode auditory sensory memory on multiple time scales. This SSA might play a role in stream segregation and in binding of auditory objects over many time scales, a property that is crucial for processing of natural auditory scenes in cats and of speech and music in humans.},

@article{Brand2002,
abstract = {Microsecond differences in the arrival time of a sound at the two ears (interaural time differences, ITDs) are the main cue for localizing low-frequency sounds in space. Traditionally, ITDs are thought to be encoded by an array of coincidence-detector neurons, receiving excitatory inputs from the two ears via axons of variable length ('delay lines'), to create a topographic map of azimuthal auditory space. Compelling evidence for the existence of such a map in the mammalian lTD detector, the medial superior olive (MSO), however, is lacking. Equally puzzling is the role of a--temporally very precise glycine--mediated inhibitory input to MSO neurons. Using in vivo recordings from the MSO of the Mongolian gerbil, we found the responses of ITD-sensitive neurons to be inconsistent with the idea of a topographic map of auditory space. Moreover, local application of glycine and its antagonist strychnine by iontophoresis (through glass pipette electrodes, by means of an electric current) revealed that precisely timed glycine-controlled inhibition is a critical part of the mechanism by which the physiologically relevant range of ITDs is encoded in the MSO. A computer model, simulating the response of a coincidence-detector neuron with bilateral excitatory inputs and a temporally precise contralateral inhibitory input, supports this conclusion.},

abstract = {A commercially-available laser Doppler-shift velocimeter has been coupled to a compound microscope equipped with ultra-long-working-distance objectives for the purpose of measuring basilar membrane vibrations in the chinchilla. The animal preparation is nearly identical to that used in our laboratory for similar measurements using the M{\"{o}}ssbauer technique. The vibrometer head is mounted on the third tube of the microscope's trinocular head and its laser beam is focused on high-refractive-index glass microbeads (10-30 microns) previously dropped, through the perilymph of scala tympani, on the basilar membrane. For equal sampling times, overall sensitivity of the laser velocimetry system is at least one order of magnitude greater than usually attained using the M{\"{o}}ssbauer technique. However, the most important advantage of laser-velocimetry vis-{\`{a}}-vis the M{\"{o}}ssbauer technique is its linearity, which permits undistorted recording of signals over a wide velocity range. Thus, for example, we have measured basilar-membrane responses to clicks whose waveforms have dynamic ranges exceeding 60 dB.},

abstract = {A new theory, called the tilt constancy theory, claims that the Ponzo illusion is caused by the misperception of orientation induced by local visual cues. The theory relates the Ponzo illusion-along with the Z{\"{o}}llner, Poggendorff, W{\"{u}}ndt-Hering, and cafe wall illusions-to the mechanisms that enable us to perceive stable orientations despite changes in retinal orientation or body orientation. In Experiment 1, the magnitude of the misperception of orientation was compared with the magnitude of the Ponzo illusion. In Experiment 2, predictions of the tilt constancy theory were compared with accounts based on (1) low spatial frequencies in the image, (2) memory comparisons (pool-and-store model), and (3) relative sizejudgments. In Experiment 3, predictions of the tilt constancy theory were tested against predictions of the assimilation theory of Pressey and his colleagues. In the final experiment, the orientation account was compared with theories based on linear perspective and inappropriate size constancy. The results support the tilt constancy theory.},

@article{Root2007,
abstract = {Investigating how information propagates between layers in the olfactory system is an important step toward understanding the olfactory code. Each glomerular output projection neuron (PN) receives two sources of input: the olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) of the same glomerulus and interneurons that innervate many glomeruli. We therefore asked how these inputs interact to produce PN output. We used receptor gene mutations to silence all of the ORNs innervating a specific glomerulus and recorded PN activity with two-photon calcium imaging and electrophysiology. We found evidence for balanced excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs but saw little or no response in the absence of direct ORN input. We next asked whether any transformation of activity occurs at successive layers of the antennal lobe. We found a strong link between PN firing and dendritic calcium elevation, the latter of which is tightly correlated with calcium activity in ORN axons, supporting the idea of glomerular propagation of olfactory information. Finally, we showed that odors are represented by a sparse population of PNs. Together, these results are consistent with the idea that direct receptor input provides the main excitatory drive to PNs, whereas interneurons modulate PN output. Balanced excitatory and inhibitory interneuron input may provide a mechanism to adjust PN sensitivity.},

Each filter response is then rectified and divided by a weighted sum of rectified responses of neighboring filters. We show that this decomposition, with parameters optimized for the statistics of a generic ensemble of natural images or sounds, provides a good characterization of the nonlinear response properties of typical neurons in primary visual cortex or auditory nerve, respectively. These results suggest that nonlinear response properties of sensory neurons are not an accident of biological implementation, but have an important functional role.},

@article{Elhilali2008,
abstract = {Sound systems and speech technologies can benefit greatly from a deeper understanding of how the auditory system, and particularly the auditory cortex, is able to parse complex acoustic scenes into meaningful auditory objects and streams under adverse conditions. In the current work, a biologically plausible model of this process is presented, where the role of cortical mechanisms in organizing complex auditory scenes is explored. The model consists of two stages: (i) a feature analysis stage that maps the acoustic input into a multidimensional cortical representation and (ii) an integrative stage that recursively builds up expectations of how streams evolve over time and reconciles its predictions with the incoming sensory input by sorting it into different clusters. This approach yields a robust computational scheme for speaker separation under conditions of speech or music interference. The model can also emulate the archetypal streaming percepts of tonal stimuli that have long been tested in human subjects. The implications of this model are discussed with respect to the physiological correlates of streaming in the cortex as well as the role of attention and other top-down influences in guiding sound organization.},

abstract = {Three experiments studied auditory streaming using sequences of alternating "ABA" triplets, where "A" and "B" were 50-ms tones differing in frequency by $\Delta$f semitones and separated by 75-ms gaps. Experiment 1 showed that detection of a short increase in the gap between a B tone and the preceding A tone, imposed on one ABA triplet, was better when the delay occurred early versus late in the sequence, and for $\Delta$f = 4 vs. $\Delta$f = 8. The results of this experiment were consistent with those of a subjective streaming judgment task. Experiment 2 showed that the detection of a delay 12.5 s into a 13.5-s sequence could be improved by requiring participants to perform a task on competing stimuli presented to the other ear for the first 10 s of that sequence. Hence, adding an additional task demand could improve performance via its effect on the perceptual organization of a sound sequence. The results demonstrate that attention affects streaming in an objective task and that the effects of build-up are not completely under voluntary control. In particular, even though build-up can impair performance in an objective task, participants are unable to prevent this from happening.},

abstract = {Our ability to focus attention on task-relevant information and ignore distractions is reflected by differential enhancement and suppression of neural activity in sensory cortex (i.e., top-down modulation). Such selective, goal-directed modulation of activity may be intimately related to memory, such that the focus of attention biases the likelihood of successfully maintaining relevant information by limiting interference from irrelevant stimuli. Despite recent studies elucidating the mechanistic overlap between attention and memory, the relationship between top-down modulation of visual processing during working memory (WM) encoding, and subsequent recognition performance has not yet been established. Here, we provide neurophysiological evidence in healthy, young adults that top-down modulation of early visual processing ({\textless} 200 ms from stimulus onset) is intimately related to subsequent WM performance, such that the likelihood of successfully remembering relevant information is associated with limiting interference from irrelevant stimuli. The consequences of a failure to ignore distractors on recognition performance was replicated for two types of feature-based memory, motion direction and color. Moreover, attention to irrelevant stimuli was reflected neurally during the WM maintenance period as an increased memory load. These results suggest that neural enhancement of relevant information is not the primary determinant of high-level performance, but rather optimal WM performance is dependent on effectively filtering irrelevant information through neural suppression to prevent overloading a limited memory capacity.},

abstract = {A laminar organization composed of the dendritic fields of principal neurons and afferent axonal arbors has been proposed as the anatomical substrate for the frequency map at several levels of the mammalian central auditory system, including the inferior colliculus and medial geniculate body (MGB). In contrast to the auditory thalamus in most mammals, the ventral division of the rabbit medial geniculate body (MGV) has cellular laminae visible in routine Nissl stains, allowing a direct comparison of the laminar organization with the dendritic architecture and frequency organization. In total 30 presumptive relay neurons in the MGV were labeled with the juxtacellular recording method, and their dendritic arbors were fully reconstructed from serial sections with the aid of a computer microscope. The spatial organization of MGV dendritic fields was analyzed using the dendritic prism, dendritic stick, and fan-in projection methods. Quantitative spatial analyses revealed that, for MGV neurons in the central pars lateralis subdivision, the major axis of the dendritic fields (approximately 29 degrees relative to the horizontal plane) was closely aligned with that of the Nissl laminae (approximately 25 degrees). Both were oriented orthogonally to the tonotopic axis. In contrast, cells in the pars ovoidea had their major axis of orientation parallel to the anteroposterior axis of the brain. Although a bitufted dendritic field was the norm, it was not uncommon for MGV neurons to have pronounced spatial asymmetries in their dendritic fields. A model is presented that incorporates cellular laminae and oriented dendritic growth to form frequency-related slabs within the MGV.},

abstract = {A novel perspective for the necessary and sufficient conditions for primary visual perception is proposed based upon relating recent discoveries from the visual sciences to relevant foundational neurological observations. This analysis suggests that a fundamental requirement for the emergence of normal primary visual perception is the coupling between the early visual cortices in the occipital lobe subserving image content with specific areas in the parietal lobe subserving selective attention, representations of extrapersonal space, the body schema, and the initiation of perceptual ownership. Fully intact primary visual perception, which includes the normal placement of image content within extrapersonal space, seems to require at each instant a mutually consistent completeness and corresponding removal of ambiguities in each of the linked neural representations subserving image, space and self. Experimental approaches that could either invalidate or strengthen the proposed framework are suggested as well as opportunities to differentiate some aspects of normal primary visual perception from the severely compromised visual experience that survives bilateral parieto-occipital lesions (Balint's syndrome) when visual experience may persist for single but unlocalizable objects.},

abstract = {There are two radically different views on the functional role of the dorsal visual stream. One considers it as a system involved in space perception. The other is of a system that codes visual information for action organization. On the basis of new anatomical data and a reconsideration of previous functional and clinical data, we propose that the dorsal stream and its recipient parietal areas form two distinct functional systems: the dorso-dorsal stream (d-d stream) and the ventro-dorsal stream (v-d stream). The d-d stream is formed by area V6 (main d-d extrastriate visual node) and areas V6A and MIP of the superior parietal lobule. Its major functional role is the control of actions "on line". Its damage leads to optic ataxia. The v-d stream is formed by area MT (main v-d extrastriate visual node) and by the visual areas of the inferior parietal lobule. As the d-d stream, v-d stream is responsible for action organization. It, however, also plays a crucial role in space perception and action understanding. The putative mechanisms linking action and perception in the v-d stream is discussed.},

The visual stimuli that excite V1 can be well controlled, and the thalamic inputs to V1 from the LGN have been measured precisely. Much has been learned about basic principles of cortical neurophysiology on account of the intense investigation of the transformation between LGN and V1. Here we present a discussion of different models for visual cortex and orientation selectivity, and then discuss our own experimental findings about the dynamics of orientation selectivity. We consider what these theoretical analyses and experimental results imply about cerebral cortical function. The conclusion is that there is a very important role for intracortical interactions, especially cortico-cortical inhibition, in producing neurons in the visual cortex highly selective for orientation.},

The authors note that the attribution of negative priming to an inhibitory mechanism of attention draws its support from a common assumption underlying priming procedures, together with the procedure that has been used to measure negative priming. The results from a series of experiments demonstrate that selection between 2 competing prime items is not required to observe negative priming. This result is demonstrated across several experiments in which participants named 1 of 2 items in a second display following presentation of a single-item prime. The implications of these results for existing theories of negative priming are discussed, and a theoretical framework for interpreting negative priming and several related phenomena is forwarded.},

@article{Tardif2005,
abstract = {The superior colliculus (SC) is believed to play an important role in sensorimotor integration and orienting behavior. It is classically divided into superficial layers predominantly containing visual neurons and deep layers containing multisensory and premotor neurons. Investigations of intrinsic connectivity within the SC in non-human species initially led to controversy regarding the existence of interlaminar connections between superficial and deep layers. It now seems more likely that such connections exist in a number of species, including non-human primates. In the latter, anatomical data concerning intrinsic SC connectivity are restricted to a limited number of intracellularly labeled neurons. No studies have been conducted to investigate the existence of intrinsic connections of human SC. In the present study, DiI (1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'- tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate) and BDA (biotinylated dextran amine) were two tracers used in post-mortem human brains to examine intrinsic SC connections. Injections into the superficial layers revealed tangential connections within superficial layers and radial superficial-layer to deep-layer connections. Within superficial layers, horizontal connections were found over the entire rostro-caudal axis and were mostly directed laterally, i.e. toward the brachium of the inferior colliculus. Superficial-layer to deep-layer connections were more prominent in sections containing the injection site or located close to it. In these sections, an axon bundle having roughly the same diameter as the injection site crossed all deep layers, and individual axons displayed en passant or terminal boutons. The present results suggest that intrinsic connections within superficial layers and radial superficial-layers to deep-layers exist in human SC. The putative roles of these connections are discussed with regard to visual receptive field organization, as well as visuomotor and multisensory integration.},

@article{Fishman2001,
abstract = {An important feature of auditory scene analysis is the perceptual organization of sequential sound components, or 'auditory stream segregation'. Auditory stream segregation can be demonstrated by presenting a sequence of high and low frequency tones in an alternating pattern, ABAB. When the tone presentation rate (PR) is slow or the frequency separation (DeltaF) between the tones is small ({\textless}10{\%}), a connected alternating sequence ABAB is perceived. When the PR is fast or the DeltaF is large, however, the alternating sequence perceptually splits into two parallel auditory streams, one composed of interrupted 'A' tones, and the other of interrupted 'B' tones. The neurophysiological basis of this perceptual phenomenon is unknown. Neural correlates of auditory stream segregation were examined in A1 of the awake monkey using neuronal ensemble techniques (multiunit activity and current source density). Responses evoked by alternating frequency sequences of tones, ABAB, were studied as a function of PR (5, 10, 20 and 40 Hz). 'A' tones corresponded to the best frequency (BF) of the cortical site, while 'B' tones were situated away from the BF by an amount DeltaF. At slow PRs, 'A' and 'B' tones evoked responses that generated an overall pattern of activity at the stimulus PR. In contrast, at fast PRs, 'B' tone responses were differentially suppressed, resulting in a pattern of activity consisting predominantly of 'A' tone responses at half the PR. The magnitude of 'B' tone response suppression increased with DeltaF. Differential suppression of BF and non-BF tone responses at high PRs can be explained by physiological principles of forward masking. The effect of DeltaF is explained by the hypothesis that responses to tones distant from the BF are more susceptible to suppression by BF tones than responses to tones near the BF. These results parallel human psychoacoustics of auditory stream segregation and suggest a cortical basis for the perceptual phenomenon.},

abstract = {The concept of receptive field is a linear, feed-forward view of visual signal processing. Frequently used models of V1 neurons, like the dynamic Linear filter--static nonlinearity--Poisson [corrected] spike encoder model, predict that receptive fields measured with different stimulus ensembles should be similar. Here, we tested this concept by comparing spatiotemporal maps of V1 neurons derived from two very different, but commonly used, stimulus ensembles: sparse noise and Hartley subspace stimuli. We found maps from the two methods agreed for neurons in input layer 4C but were very different for neurons in superficial layers of V1. Many layer 2/3 cells have receptive fields with multiple elongated subregions when mapped with Hartley stimuli, but their spatial maps collapse to only a single, less-elongated subregion when mapped with sparse noise. Moreover, for upper layer V1 neurons, the preferred orientation for Hartley maps is much closer to the preferred orientation measured with drifting gratings than is the orientation preference of sparse-noise maps. These results challenge the concept of a stimulus-invariant receptive field and imply that intracortical interactions shape fundamental properties of layer 2/3 neurons.},

abstract = {Vision scientists long ago pointed to black and white as separate sensations and saw confirmation in the fact that in the absence of light, one perceives the visual field as gray against which the negative after-image of a bright light appeared blacker. The first recordings from optic nerve fibers in vertebrates revealed ON and OFF signals, later associated with separate streams, arising already at the synapse between receptors and bipolar cells. These can be identified anatomically and physiologically and remain distinct all the way to the lateral geniculate nucleus, whose fibers form the input to the primary visual cortex. The dichotomy has been probed by electroretinography and analyzed by means of pharmacological agents and dysfunction due to genetic causes. The bi- rather than a unidirectional nature of the retinal output has advantages in allowing small signals to remain prominent over a greater dynamic range. The two streams innervate cortical neurons in a push-pull manner, generating receptive fields with spatial sensitivity profiles featuring ON and OFF subregions. Manifestations of the dichotomy appear in a variety of simple visual discriminations where there are often profound threshold differences in patterns with same polarity as compared with mixed contrast-polarity components. But even at levels in which the spatial, contrast and color attributes have already been securely established and black and white elements participate equally, a categorical difference between blackness and whiteness of a percept persists. It is an opponency, akin to the ones in the color domain, derived from the original ON and OFF signals and subsequently bound with the other attributes to yield a feature's unitary percept.},

The reason for this behavior has remained a mystery. We study an experimentally motivated model of the thalamic input-recipient layer of cat primary visual cortex that accounts for many aspects of cortical orientation tuning. In this circuit, inhibition dominates over excitation, but temporal modulations of excitation and inhibition occur out of phase with one another, allowing excitation to transiently drive cells. We show that this circuit provides a natural explanation of cortical low-pass temporal frequency tuning, provided N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are present in thalamocortical synapses in proportions measured experimentally. This suggests a new and unanticipated role for NMDA conductances in shaping the temporal response properties of cortical cells, and suggests that common cortical circuit mechanisms underlie both spatial and temporal response tuning.},

Ss' loudness adjustment of the Gausian noise was analyzed by signal detection theory and nonparametric statistics. Silent periods were interpolated between the variable noise and the Ss' auditory anchor. During the delay periods the Ss had to preserve their auditory cutoff point (anchor) in memory. Data indicate that the half-life of echoic memory was less than 1 sec ( p {\textless} 0.01). However, this memory was not a static enty. There was an interaction between concurrent verbal judgments and the duration of echoic memory. When verbal judgments accompanied the cross-modality matching the half-life of echoic memory was extended to over 3 sec. Verbal judgments decayed when silent intervals were interpolated between segments of auditory information. Results indicate that nonsymbolic auditory material is processed first, and when an auditory decision has been derived, the verbal judgments are then based upon the auditory decision, a serial processor. },

Trichromatic color vision begins when the image is sampled by short- (S), middle- (M) and long- (L) wavelength-sensitive cone photoreceptors. Diverse retinal cell types combine the cone signals to create separate luminance, red-green, and blue-yellow pathways. Each pathway is associated with distinctive retinal architectures. Thus a blue-yellow pathway originates in a bistratified ganglion cell type and associated interneurons that combine excitation from S cones and inhibition from L and M cones. By contrast, a red-green pathway, in which signals from L and M cones are opposed, is associated with the specialized anatomy of the primate fovea, in which the "midget" ganglion cells receive dominant excitatory input from a single L or M cone.},

abstract = {Because the inner ear is not organized spatially, sound localization relies on the neural processing of implicit acoustic cues. To determine a sound's position, the brain must learn and calibrate these cues, using accurate spatial feedback from other sensorimotor systems. Experimental evidence for such a system has been demonstrated in barn owls, but not in humans. Here, we demonstrate the existence of ongoing spatial calibration in the adult human auditory system. The spectral elevation cues of human subjects were disrupted by modifying their outer ears (pinnae) with molds. Although localization of sound elevation was dramatically degraded immediately after the modification, accurate performance was steadily reacquired. Interestingly, learning the new spectral cues did not interfere with the neural representation of the original cues, as subjects could localize sounds with both normal and modified pinnae.},

abstract = {Now that the study of consciousness is warmly embraced by cognitive scientists, much confusion seems to arise between the concepts of visual attention and visual awareness. Often, visual awareness is equated to what is in the focus of attention. There are, however, two sets of arguments to separate attention from awareness: a psychological/theoretical one and a neurobiological one. By combining these arguments I present definitions of visual attention and awareness that clearly distinguish between the two, yet explain why attention and awareness are so intricately related. In fact, there seems more overlap between mechanisms of memory and awareness than between those of attention and awareness.},

abstract = {Auditory objects are detected if they differ acoustically from the ongoing background. In simple cases, the appearance or disappearance of an object involves a transition in power, or frequency content, of the ongoing sound. However, it is more realistic that the background and object possess substantial non-stationary statistics, and the task is then to detect a transition in the pattern of ongoing statistics. How does the system detect and process such transitions? We use magnetoencephalography (MEG) to measure early auditory cortical responses to transitions between constant tones, regularly alternating, and randomly alternating tone-pip sequences. Such transitions embody key characteristics of natural auditory temporal edges. Our data demonstrate that the temporal dynamics and response polarity of the neural temporal-edge-detection processes depend in specific ways on the generalized nature of the edge (the context preceding and following the transition) and suggest that distinct neural substrates in core and non-core auditory cortex are recruited depending on the kind of computation (discovery of a violation of regularity, vs. the detection of a new regularity) required to extract the edge from the ongoing fluctuating input entering a listener's ears.},

abstract = {We can claim that we know what the visual system does once we can predict neural responses to arbitrary stimuli, including those seen in nature. In the early visual system, models based on one or more linear receptive fields hold promise to achieve this goal as long as the models include nonlinear mechanisms that control responsiveness, based on stimulus context and history, and take into account the nonlinearity of spike generation. These linear and nonlinear mechanisms might be the only essential determinants of the response, or alternatively, there may be additional fundamental determinants yet to be identified. Research is progressing with the goals of defining a single "standard model" for each stage of the visual pathway and testing the predictive power of these models on the responses to movies of natural scenes. These predictive models represent, at a given stage of the visual pathway, a compact description of visual computation. They would be an invaluable guide for understanding the underlying biophysical and anatomical mechanisms and relating neural responses to visual perception.},

abstract = {The recordable cerebral activity (readiness-potential, RP) that precedes a freely voluntary, fully endogenous motor act was directly compared with the reportable time (W) for appearance of the subjective experience of 'wanting' or intending to act. The onset of cerebral activity clearly preceded by at least several hundred milliseconds the reported time of conscious intention to act. This relationship held even for those series (with 'type II' RPs) in which subjects reported that all of the 40 self-initiated movements in the series appeared 'spontaneously' and capriciously. Data were obtained in at least 6 different experimental sessions with each of 5 subjects. In series with type II RPs, onset of the main negative shift in each RP preceded the corresponding mean W value by an average of about 350 ms, and by a minimum of about 150 ms. In series with type I RPs, in which an experience of preplanning occurred in some of the 40 self-initiated acts, onset of RP preceded W by an average of about 800 ms (or by 500 ms, taking onset of RP at 90 per cent of its area). Reports of W time depended upon the subject's recall of the spatial 'clock-position' of a revolving spot at the time of his initial awareness of wanting or intending to move. Two different modes of recall produced similar values. Subjects distinguished awareness of wanting to move (W) from awareness of actually moving (M). W times were consistently and substantially negative to, in advance of, mean times reported for M and also those for S, the sensation elicited by a task-related skin stimulus delivered at irregular times that were unknown to the subject. It is concluded that cerebral initiation of a spontaneous, freely voluntary act can begin unconsciously, that is, before there is any (at least recallable) subjective awareness that a 'decision' to act has already been initiated cerebrally. This introduces certain constraints on the potentiality for conscious initiation and control of voluntary acts.},

@article{Nelson1980,
abstract = {The somatotopic organization of the postcentral parietal cortex of the Old World monkey, Macaca fascicularis, was determined with multi-unit microelectrode recordings. The results lead to the following conclusions: 1) There are at least two complete and systematic representations of the contralateral body surface in the cortex of the postcentral gyrus. One representation is contained within Area 3b, the other within Area 1. 2) While there are important differences in the organization of the two representations, they are basically mirror-images of each other. 3) Each representation maintains body-surface adjacency by cortical adjacency in some mediolateral regions. In other regions, two types of discontinuities can be described: first, in which adjacent body surfaces are represented in separate cortical loci; second, in which adjacent cortical regions represent disparate body-surface regions. The internal organization of each representation is better described as a composite of somatotopic regions (Merzenich et al., '78) than as a serial array of dermatomal bands, or as a "homunculus." 4) While architectonic Area 2 responds to stimulation of deep body tissue, at least parts of Area 2 also respond to cutaneous stimulation. The organiation of the cutaneous representation of the hand in Area 2 is basically a mirror-image of the hand representation in Area 1. 5) Area 3a is activated by deep body tissue stimulation, suggesting the possibility of a fourth body representation within the traditional "S-I" region of somatosensory cortex in macaques. In accord with a previous study in a New World monkey (Merzenich et al., '78), we suggest that the cutaneous representation in Area 3b be considered as SI proper, and that the cutaneous representation in Area 1 be termed the posterior cutaneous field. Furthermore, based on the orientation of the representations of the body surface, as well as other factors, we suggest that the representation in Area 3b is homologous to "SmI" (or "SI") in non-primates.},

A recently proposed class of quality metrics, known as structural similarity metrics (SSIM), models perception implicitly by taking into account the fact that the HVS is adapted for extracting structural information from images. We evaluate SSIM metrics and compare their performance to traditional approaches in the context of realistic distortions that arise from compression and error concealment in video compression/transmission applications. In order to better explore this space of distortions, we propose models for simulating typical distortions encountered in such applications. We compare specific SSIM implementations both in the image space and the wavelet domain; these include the complex wavelet SSIM (CWSSIM), a translation-insensitive SSIM implementation. We also propose a perceptually weighted multiscale variant of CWSSIM, which introduces a viewing distance dependence and provides a natural way to unify the structural similarity approach with the traditional JND-based perceptual approaches.},

We use this perspective to show that the primate ventral visual processing stream achieves a particularly effective solution in which single-neuron invariance is not the goal. Finally, we speculate on the key neuronal mechanisms that could enable this solution, which, if understood, would have far-reaching implications for cognitive neuroscience.},

A fundamental question, however, remains unresolved: How do people perceive objects, albeit with binding errors (illusory conjunctions), when attentional resolution is poor? We used a novel technique to investigate how features are selected to create percepts of bound objects. We measured the correlation of errors (intrusions) in color and identity reports in spatial and temporal selection tasks under conditions of varying spatial or temporal uncertainty. Our findings suggest that attention selects each feature independently by randomly sampling from a probability distribution over space or time. Thus, veridical perception of bound object features arises only when attentional selection is sufficiently precise that the independently sampled features originate from a single object.},

Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press] proposed a functional division of labor between vision-for-perception and vision-for-action. Their proposal is supported by neuropsychological, brain-imaging, and psychophysical evidence. However, it has remained controversial in the prediction that actions are not affected by visual illusions. Following up on a related review on pointing (see Bruno et al., 2008 [Bruno, N., Bernardis, P., {\&} Gentilucci, M. (2008). Visually guided pointing, the M{\"{u}}ller-Lyer illusion, and the functional interpretation of the dorsal-ventral split: Conclusions from 33 independent studies. Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews, 32(3), 423-437]), here we re-analyze 18 studies on grasping objects embedded in the M{\"{u}}ller-Lyer (ML) illusion. We find that median percent effects across studies are indeed larger for perceptual than for grasping measures. However, almost all grasping effects are larger than zero and the two distributions show substantial overlap and variability. A fine-grained analysis reveals that critical roles in accounting for this variability are played by the informational basis for guiding the action, by the number of trials per condition of the experiment, and by the angle of the illusion fins. When all these factors are considered together, the data support a difference between grasping and perception only when online visual feedback is available during movement. Thus, unlike pointing, grasping studies of the M{\"{u}}ller-Lyer (ML) illusion suggest that the perceptual and motor effects of the illusion differ only because of online, feedback-driven corrections, and do not appear to support independent spatial representations for vision-for-action and vision-for-perception.},

abstract = {Primary and secondary visual cortex (V1 and V2) form the foundation of the cortical visual system. V1 transforms information received from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and distributes it to separate domains in V2 for transmission to higher visual areas. During the past 20 years, schemes for the functional organization of V1 and V2 have been based on a tripartite framework developed by Livingstone {\&} Hubel (1988) . Since then, new anatomical data have accumulated concerning V1's input, its internal circuitry, and its output to V2. These new data, along with physiological and imaging studies, now make it likely that the visual attributes of color, form, and motion are not neatly segregated by V1 into different stripe compartments in V2. Instead, there are just two main streams, originating from cytochrome oxidase patches and interpatches, that project to V2. Each stream is composed of a mixture of magno, parvo, and konio geniculate signals. Further studies are required to elucidate how the patches and interpatches differ in the output they convey to extrastriate cortex.},

abstract = {Segregating streams of sounds from sources in complex acoustic scenes is crucial for perception in real world situations. We analyzed an objective psychophysical measure of stream segregation obtained while simultaneously recording forebrain neurons in the European starlings to investigate neural correlates of segregating a stream of A tones from a stream of B tones presented at one-half the rate. The objective measure, sensitivity for time shift detection of the B tone, was higher when the A and B tones were of the same frequency (one stream) compared with when there was a 6- or 12-semitone difference between them (two streams). The sensitivity for representing time shifts in spiking patterns was correlated with the behavioral sensitivity. The spiking patterns reflected the stimulus characteristics but not the behavioral response, indicating that the birds' primary cortical field represents the segregated streams, but not the decision process.},

The latter is particularly interesting since the frequency of the limit cycle oscillation is found to be a monotonic function of stimulus intensity. Finally, it is proved that the existence of limit cycle dynamics in response to one class of stimuli implies the existence of multiple stable states and hysteresis in response to a different class of stimuli. The relation between these findings and a number of experiments is discussed.},

abstract = {The auditory system of monkeys includes a large number of interconnected subcortical nuclei and cortical areas. At subcortical levels, the structural components of the auditory system of monkeys resemble those of nonprimates, but the organization at cortical levels is different. In monkeys, the ventral nucleus of the medial geniculate complex projects in parallel to a core of three primary-like auditory areas, AI, R, and RT, constituting the first stage of cortical processing. These areas interconnect and project to the homotopic and other locations in the opposite cerebral hemisphere and to a surrounding array of eight proposed belt areas as a second stage of cortical processing. The belt areas in turn project in overlapping patterns to a lateral parabelt region with at least rostral and caudal subdivisions as a third stage of cortical processing. The divisions of the parabelt distribute to adjoining auditory and multimodal regions of the temporal lobe and to four functionally distinct regions of the frontal lobe. Histochemically, chimpanzees and humans have an auditory core that closely resembles that of monkeys. The challenge for future researchers is to understand how this complex system in monkeys analyzes and utilizes auditory information.},

abstract = {Neurons in the visual cortex respond selectively to stimulus orientation and spatial frequency. Changes in response amplitudes of these neurons could be the neurophysiological basis of orientation and spatial frequency discrimination. We have estimated the minimum differences in stimulus orientation and spatial frequency that can produce reliable changes in the responses of individual neurons in cat visual cortex. We compare these values with orientation and spatial frequency discrimination thresholds determined behaviorally. Slopes of the tuning functions and response variability determine the minimum orientation and spatial frequency differences that can elicit a reliable response change. These minimum values were obtained from single cells using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The average minimum orientation and spatial frequency differences that could be signaled reliably by cells from our sample were 6.4 degrees (n = 22) and 21.3{\%} (n = 18), respectively. These values are approximately 0.20 of the average full tuning width at one-half height of the cells. Although these average values are well above the behaviorally determined thresholds, the most selective cells signaled orientation and frequency differences of 1.84 degrees and 5.25{\%}, respectively. These values are of the same order of magnitude as the behavioral thresholds. We show that, because of slow fluctuations in a cell's responsivity, ROC analysis overestimates response variability. We estimate that these slow response fluctuations elevated our estimates of single cell "thresholds" by, on average, 30{\%}. Our data point to an approximate correspondence between orientation and spatial frequency discrimination "thresholds" determined behaviorally and those estimated from the most selective single cortical cells. Interpretation of this quantitative correspondence is considered in the discussion.},

Interrogation of even deep neural circuits can be conducted by directly probing the necessity and sufficiency of defined circuit elements with millisecond-scale, cell type-specific optical perturbations, coupled with suitable readouts such as electrophysiology, optical circuit dynamics measures and freely moving behavior in mammals. Here we collect in detail our strategies for delivering microbial opsin genes to deep mammalian brain structures in vivo, along with protocols for integrating the resulting optical control with compatible readouts (electrophysiological, optical and behavioral). The procedures described here, from initial virus preparation to systems-level functional readout, can be completed within 4-5 weeks. Together, these methods may help in providing circuit-level insight into the dynamics underlying complex mammalian behaviors in health and disease.},

Previously, we showed that two interwoven sets of tones differing widely along multiple feature dimensions (duration, pitch and location) were pre-attentively separated into different groups, and that tones separated in this manner did not elicit the mismatch negativity component with respect to each other. Grouping was studied with human subjects using a stimulus rate too slow to induce streaming. Here, we varied the separation of tone sequences along a single feature dimension, i.e. frequency. Frequency differences were either 24 Hz (small) or 1054 Hz (large). Two relatively slow stimulus rates were used (2.7 or 1 tone/s) to explicitly investigate grouping outside the so-called 'streaming effect', which requires rates of about 4 tones/s or faster. Two tones were presented in a quasi-random manner with embedded trains of one to four identical tones in a row. Deviants were defined as frequency switches after trains of four identical tones. Mismatch negativity was only elicited for small frequency switches at the slower stimulation rate. The data indicate that pre-attentive grouping of tones occurred when the frequency difference that separated them was large, regardless of stimulation rate. For small frequency differences, inputs were only grouped separately when the stimulation rate was relatively fast.},

Trichromatic color vision begins when the image is sampled by short- (S), middle- (M) and long- (L) wavelength-sensitive cone photoreceptors. Diverse retinal cell types combine the cone signals to create separate luminance, red-green, and blue-yellow pathways. Each pathway is associated with distinctive retinal architectures. Thus a blue-yellow pathway originates in a bistratified ganglion cell type and associated interneurons that combine excitation from S cones and inhibition from L and M cones. By contrast, a red-green pathway, in which signals from L and M cones are opposed, is associated with the specialized anatomy of the primate fovea, in which the "midget" ganglion cells receive dominant excitatory input from a single L or M cone.},

abstract = {Post-diarrhea hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is the most common cause of acute renal failure in children in Argentina. Renal damage has been strongly associated with Shiga toxin (Stx) which binds to the globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) receptor on the plasma membrane of target cells. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the in vivo effects of C-9, a potent inhibitor of glucosylceramide (GL1) synthase and Gb3 synthesis, on kidney and colon in an experimental model of HUS in rats. Rats were intraperitoneal injected (i.p.) with supernatant from recombinant E. coli expressing Stx2 (sStx2). A group of these rats were orally treated with C-9 during 6 days, from 2 days prior to 4 days after sStx2 injection. The injection of sStx2 caused renal damage as well as a loss of goblet cells in colonic mucosa. Oral treatment with C-9 significantly decreased rat mortality to 50{\%} and reduced the extension of renal and intestinal injuries in the surviving rats. The C-9 also decreased Gb3 and GL1 expression levels in rat kidneys. It is particularly interesting that an improvement was seen when C-9 was administered 2 days before challenge, which makes it potentially useful for prophylaxis. ABBREVIATIONS:},

We used receptor gene mutations to silence all of the ORNs innervating a specific glomerulus and recorded PN activity with two-photon calcium imaging and electrophysiology. We found evidence for balanced excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs but saw little or no response in the absence of direct ORN input. We next asked whether any transformation of activity occurs at successive layers of the antennal lobe. We found a strong link between PN firing and dendritic calcium elevation, the latter of which is tightly correlated with calcium activity in ORN axons, supporting the idea of glomerular propagation of olfactory information. Finally, we showed that odors are represented by a sparse population of PNs. Together, these results are consistent with the idea that direct receptor input provides the main excitatory drive to PNs, whereas interneurons modulate PN output. Balanced excitatory and inhibitory interneuron input may provide a mechanism to adjust PN sensitivity.},

abstract = {Various visual cues provide information about depth and shape in a scene. When several of these cues are simultaneously available in a single location in the scene, the visual system attempts to combine them. In this paper, we discuss three key issues relevant to the experimental analysis of depth cue combination in human vision: cue promotion, dynamic weighting of cues, and robustness of cue combination. We review recent psychophysical studies of human depth cue combination in light of these issues. We organize the discussion and review as the development of a model of the depth cue combination process termed modified weak fusion (MWF). We relate the MWF framework to Bayesian theories of cue combination. We argue that the MWF model is consistent with previous experimental results and is a parsimonious summary of these results. While the MWF model is motivated by normative considerations, it is primarily intended to guide experimental analysis of depth cue combination in human vision. We describe experimental methods, analogous to perturbation analysis, that permit us to analyze depth cue combination in novel ways. In particular these methods allow us to investigate the key issues we have raised. We summarize recent experimental tests of the MWF framework that use these methods.},

abstract = {Considerable behavioral research has demonstrated that the visual word recognition system is sensitive to morphological structure. It has typically been assumed that analysis of morphologically complex words occurs only when the meaning of these words can be derived from the meanings of their constituents (e.g., hunter = hunt + er). However, results from recent behavioral research using the masked priming technique have demonstrated that morphological analysis can occur at an earlier orthographic level, in cases in which the meanings of complex words cannot be derived from their constituents (e.g., corner = corn + er). Here, we combine the logic of behavioral masked priming with the neurophysiological phenomenon of functional magnetic resonance imaging priming suppression to look for evidence of nonsemantic morphological priming at the neural level. Both behavioral and functional magnetic resonance imaging results indicated priming effects associated with the mere appearance of morphological structure (corner-CORN). In addition, these effects were distinguishable from lexical-semantic effects (bucket-PAIL) and orthographic effects (brothel-BROTH). Three left-lateralized occipito-temporal regions showed sensitivity to early morphological components of visual word recognition. Two of these regions also showed orthographic priming ( approximately BA 37, peak: -48 -60 -17; approximately BA 19, peak: -40 -77 -1), whereas one was sensitive only to morphological similarity between primes and targets ( approximately BA 19, peak: -37 -67 -7). These findings provide a neurobiological basis for a purely structural morphemic segmentation mechanism operating at early stages of visual word recognition.},

abstract = {Ibotenic-acid lesions of the magnocellular portion of the macaque lateral geniculate nucleus were used to examine the role of the M-cell pathway in spatio-temporal contrast sensitivity. A lesion was placed in layer 1 of the lateral geniculate of each of two monkeys. Physiological mapping in one animal demonstrated that the visual-field locus of the lesion was on the horizontal meridian, approximately 6 deg in the temporal field. Visual thresholds were tested monocularly in the contralateral eye, and fixation locus was monitored with a scleral search coil to control the retinal location of the test target. Three threshold measures were clearly disrupted by the magnocellular lesions. Contrast sensitivity for a 1 cycle/deg grating that drifted at 10 Hz was reduced from about twofold greater than, to about the same as, that for 10-Hz counterphase modulated gratings. Sensitivity for a very low spatial frequency (Gaussian blob), 10-Hz flickering stimulus was reduced so severely that no threshold could be measured. In addition, flicker resolution was greatly reduced at lower modulation depths (0.22), but not at higher depths (1.0). Two of the measured thresholds were unaffected by the lesions. Contrast sensitivity for 2 cycle/deg stationary gratings remained intact, and little or no effect on sensitivity was found for 1 cycle/deg, 10-Hz counterphase modulated gratings. Together, these results suggest that the magnocellular pathway makes little contribution to visual sensitivity at low to moderate temporal frequencies. On the other hand, some contribution to detection sensitivity is evident at lower spatial and high temporal frequencies, especially for drifting stimuli.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Yet, it has been difficult to obtain unambiguous evidence for the independence of declarative memory and priming. The authors report the first demonstration, using matched tests, of fully intact perceptual memory (priming) in a profoundly amnesic patient (E.P.), despite at-chance recognition memory. The priming and recognition tests included tests that were matched with respect to test materials, length of the study and test lists, and the kind of cues available at test. Priming appears to reflect neural changes within perceptual processing systems that occur before information reaches the brain systems that transform visual perception into conscious visual memory.},

Mechanistically, this is a difficult task because the responsiveness of a large heterogeneous population of interconnected neurons must be adjusted properly and precisely. Synaptic short-term plasticity (STP) is widely regarded as a viable mechanism for adaptive processes. Although the cellular mechanism for STP is well characterized, the overall effect on information processing at the network level is poorly understood. The main challenge is that there are many cell types in auditory cortex, each of which exhibit different forms and degrees of STP. In this article, I will review the basic properties of STP in auditory cortical circuits and discuss the possible impact on signal processing. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

We investigated whether the pre-attentive mechanisms underlying auditory stream segregation operate similarly in school-aged (7--10 years of age) children and adults. We used an electrophysiological index of auditory change detection that does not require the experimental participant to focus on the sounds to be evoked. In Experiment 1, children were presented with mixtures of high and low frequency tones in different conditions and were instructed to watch a silent video and ignore the sounds. In Experiment 2, children were asked to listen to the same sets of sounds as presented in Experiment 1 and tell whether they heard one or two auditory streams. The pre-attentive processing of the mixture of sounds as one or two auditory streams (Experiment 1), matched with the perception of the sounds as one or two distinct streams (Experiment 2). Our results demonstrate that the mechanisms for auditory stream segregation operate similarly in school-aged children and adults when frequency proximity is the cue for segregation.},

abstract = {We investigated the hypothesis that task performance can rapidly and adaptively reshape cortical receptive field properties in accord with specific task demands and salient sensory cues. We recorded neuronal responses in the primary auditory cortex of behaving ferrets that were trained to detect a target tone of any frequency. Cortical plasticity was quantified by measuring focal changes in each cell's spectrotemporal response field (STRF) in a series of passive and active behavioral conditions. STRF measurements were made simultaneously with task performance, providing multiple snapshots of the dynamic STRF during ongoing behavior. Attending to a specific target frequency during the detection task consistently induced localized facilitative changes in STRF shape, which were swift in onset. Such modulatory changes may enhance overall cortical responsiveness to the target tone and increase the likelihood of 'capturing' the attended target during the detection task. Some receptive field changes persisted for hours after the task was over and hence may contribute to long-term sensory memory.},

Although change blindness resulted in some extrastriate activity, the dorsal activations were clearly absent.

abstract = {An important aspect of the analysis of auditory "scenes" relates to the perceptual organization of sound sequences into auditory "streams." In this study, we adapted two auditory perception tasks, used in recent human psychophysical studies, to obtain behavioral measures of auditory streaming in ferrets (Mustela putorius). One task involved the detection of shifts in the frequency of tones within an alternating tone sequence. The other task involved the detection of a stream of regularly repeating target tones embedded within a randomly varying multitone background. In both tasks, performance was measured as a function of various stimulus parameters, which previous psychophysical studies in humans have shown to influence auditory streaming. Ferret performance in the two tasks was found to vary as a function of these parameters in a way that is qualitatively consistent with the human data. These results suggest that auditory streaming occurs in ferrets, and that the two tasks described here may provide a valuable tool in future behavioral and neurophysiological studies of the phenomenon.},

abstract = {To investigate the subcortical connections of inferior temporal cortex, we injected its anterior and posterior portions (Bonin and Bailey's cytoarchitectonic areas TE and TEO, respectively) in 6 rhesus monkeys with retrograde and anterograde tracers. The results indicate that both areas TE and TEO receive nonreciprocal inputs from several thalamic nuclei, including paracentralis, ventralis anterior, centralis, and limitans, and that TE also receives input from reuniens. Additional nonreciprocal inputs to both areas arise from the hypothalamus, basal nucleus of Meynert, dorsal and median raphe, locus coeruleus, and reticular formation. TE and TEO are reciprocally connected with the lateral, medial, and inferior nuclei of the pulvinar and with the ventral portion of the claustrum. The main subcortical nonreciprocal output from TE and TEO is to the striatum and from TEO to the superior colliculus. TE also sends a very limited projection to nucleus medialis dorsalis magnocellularis of the thalamus. Although the connections of areas TE and TEO are overlapping in most subcortical structures, they are partially segregated in the pulvinar, the reticular nucleus of the thalamus, and the striatum. Specifically, relative to those of TE, the projections of TEO are located more laterally in the medial, lateral, and inferior nuclei of the pulvinar, more ventrally in the reticular nucleus, and more caudally in both the ventral putamen and tail and head of the caudate nucleus.},

Although N-back has become a standard "executive" working memory (WM) measure in cognitive neuroscience, it has been subjected to few behavioral tests of construct validity. A combined experimental- correlational study tested the attention-control demands of verbal 2- and 3-back tasks by presenting n = 1 "lure" foils. Lures elicited more false alarms than control foils in both 2- and 3-back tasks, and lures caused more misses to targets that immediately followed them compared with control targets, but only in 3-back tasks. N-back thus challenges control over familiarity-based responding. Participants also completed a verbal WM span task (operation span task) and a marker test of general fluid intelligence (Gf; Ravens Advanced Progressive Matrices Test; J. C. Raven, J. E. Raven, {\&} J. H. Court, 1998). N-back and WM span correlated weakly, suggesting they do not reflect primarily a single construct; moreover, both accounted for independent variance in Gf.

abstract = {The negative priming (NP) effect refers to the observed increase in identification time for a current target stimulus or stimulus feature (the "probe") that has been employed as a distractor stimulus or stimulus feature on the previous trial (the "prime"), representing strong evidence that ignored information is actively processed to a high level by selective attention systems. However, theoretical accounts of NP differ in whether they attribute the effect to processes of selective inhibition or episodic memory retrieval. Here we derived neurophysiological predictions from the rival "selective inhibition" and "episodic retrieval" models of NP, and employed event-related fMRI in a color-naming Stroop task to assess neural responses to probe trials that were subject to either no priming or negative priming. Compared to no-priming probe trials, NP resulted in increased activation of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, in a region which has been closely linked with episodic memory retrieval functions. NP was also accompanied by activation of the right thalamus, particularly the mediodorsal nucleus, which has been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, a condition associated with diminished NP effects. Our results support the proposal that ignored stimulus information is fully encoded in memory, and that episodic retrieval, not selective inhibition, of such information affects selective attention performance on subsequent trials.},

abstract = {We have previously reported that sound sequence discrimination learning requires cholinergic inputs to the auditory cortex (AC) in rats. In that study, reward was used for motivating discrimination behavior in rats. Therefore, dopaminergic inputs mediating reward signals may have an important role in the learning. We tested the possibility in the present study. Rats were trained to discriminate sequences of two sound components, and licking behavior in response to one of the two sequences was rewarded with water. To identify the dopaminergic inputs responsible for the learning, dopaminergic afferents to the AC were lesioned with local injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). The injection attenuated sound sequence discrimination learning, while it had no effect on discrimination between the sound components of the sequence stimuli. Local injection of 6-OHDA into the nucleus accumbens attenuated sound discrimination learning. However, not only discrimination learning of sound sequence but also that of the sound components were impaired. SCH23390 (0.2 mg/kg, i.p.), a D1 receptor antagonist, had no effect on sound sequence discrimination learning, while it attenuated the licking behavior to unfamiliar stimuli. Haloperidol (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.), a D2 family antagonist, attenuated sound sequence discrimination learning, while it had no clear suppressive effect on discrimination of two different sound components and licking. These results suggest that D2 family receptors activated by dopaminergic inputs to the AC are required for sound sequence discrimination learning.},

This amount of reorganization was considered to be an upper limit imposed by the size of the projection zones of individual thalamocortical axons, which typically also extend a mediolateral distance of 1 to 2 millimeters. However, after extensive long-term deafferentations in adult primates, changes in cortical maps were found to be an order of magnitude greater than those previously described. These results show the need for a reevaluation of both the upper limit of cortical reorganization in adult primates and the mechanisms responsible for it.},

@article{Carandini1997,
abstract = {Simple cells in the primary visual cortex often appear to compute a weighted sum of the light intensity distribution of the visual stimuli that fall on their receptive fields. A linear model of these cells has the advantage of simplicity and captures a number of basic aspects of cell function. It, however, fails to account for important response nonlinearities, such as the decrease in response gain and latency observed at high contrasts and the effects of masking by stimuli that fail to elicit responses when presented alone. To account for these nonlinearities we have proposed a normalization model, which extends the linear model to include mutual shunting inhibition among a large number of cortical cells. Shunting inhibition is divisive, and its effect in the model is to normalize the linear responses by a measure of stimulus energy. To test this model we performed extracellular recordings of simple cells in the primary visual cortex of anesthetized macaques. We presented large stimulus sets consisting of (1) drifting gratings of various orientations and spatiotemporal frequencies; (2) plaids composed of two drifting gratings; and (3) gratings masked by full-screen spatiotemporal white noise. We derived expressions for the model predictions and fitted them to the physiological data. Our results support the normalization model, which accounts for both the linear and the nonlinear properties of the cells. An alternative model, in which the linear responses are subject to a compressive nonlinearity, did not perform nearly as well.},

@article{Yabe2001,
abstract = {The present study examined the relationship between two of the early brain processes of sound organization: auditory streaming and the temporal window of integration (TWI). Presented at a fast stimulus delivery rate, two tones alternating in frequency are perceived as separate streams of high and low sounds. However, when two sounds are presented within a ca. 200 ms temporal window, they are often processed as a single auditory event. Both stream segregation and temporal integration occur even in the absence of focused attention as was shown by their effect on the mismatch negativity (MMN) event-related potential. The goal of the present study was to determine the precedence between these two sound organization processes by using the stimulus-omission MMN paradigm. Infrequently omitting one stimulus from a homogeneous tone sequence only elicits an MMN when the stimulus onset asynchrony separating successive tones is shorter than 170 ms. This demonstrates the effect of the TWI. Magnetic brain responses elicited by infrequent stimulus omissions appearing in a sequence of two alternating tones were recorded. The magnetic MMN was elicited by tone omission when the alternating tones formed a single stream (with no or only small frequency separation between the two tones) but not when separate high and low streams emerged in perception (large frequency separation between the two alternating tones). This result shows that auditory streaming takes precedence over the processes of temporal integration.},

Nineteen subjects received fMRI scans as they played a series of single-shot Prisoner's Dilemma games with partners who were outside the scanner. In both ventromedial prefrontal cortex and ventral striatum, reciprocated and unreciprocated cooperation were associated with positive and negative BOLD responses, respectively. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that mesencephalic dopamine projection sites carry information about errors in reward prediction that allow us to learn who can and cannot be trusted to reciprocate favors.},

abstract = {We report a computer simulation of the visuospatial delayed-response experiments of Funahashi et al. (1989), using a firing-rate model that combines intrinsic cellular bistability with the recurrent local network architecture of the neocortex. In our model, the visuospatial working memory is stored in the form of a continuum of network activity profiles that coexist with a spontaneous activity state. These neuronal firing patterns provide a population code for the cue position in a graded manner. We show that neuronal persistent activity and tuning curves of delay-period activity (memory fields) can be generated by an excitatory feedback circuit and recurrent synaptic inhibition. However, if the memory fields are constructed solely by network mechanisms, noise may induce a random drift over time in the encoded cue position, so that the working memory storage becomes unreliable. Furthermore, a "distraction" stimulus presented during the delay period produces a systematic shift in the encoded cue position. We found that the working memory performance can be rendered robust against noise and distraction stimuli if single neurons are endowed with cellular bistability (presumably due to intrinsic ion channel mechanisms) that is conditional and realized only with sustained synaptic inputs from the recurrent network. We discuss how cellular bistability at the single cell level may be detected by analysis of spike trains recorded during delay-period activity and how local modulation of intrinsic cell properties and/or synaptic transmission can alter the memory fields of individual neurons in the prefrontal cortex.},

The view that there might be a gene for spatial cognition or language has emanated from a focus on the structure of the adult brain in neuropsychological patients whose brains were fully and normally developed until their brain insult. The developing brain is very different. It starts out highly interconnected across regions and is neither localized nor specialized at birth, allowing interaction with the environment to play an important role in gene expression and the ultimate cognitive phenotype. This article takes a neuroconstructivist perspective, arguing that domain-specific end states can stem from more domain-general start states, that associations may turn out to be as informative as dissociations, and that genetic mutations that alter the trajectory of ontogenetic development can inform nature/nurture debates.},

abstract = {The trichromatic primate retina parses the colour content of a visual scene into 'red/green' and 'blue/yellow' representations. Cortical circuits must combine the information encoded in these colour-opponent signals to reconstruct the full range of perceived colours. Red/green and blue/yellow inputs are relayed by the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of thalamus to primary visual cortex (V1), so understanding how cortical circuits transform these signals requires understanding how LGN inputs to V1 are organized. Here we report direct recordings from LGN afferent axons in muscimol-inactivated V1. We found that blue/yellow afferents terminated exclusively in superficial cortical layers 3B and 4A, whereas red/green afferents were encountered only in deeper cortex, in lower layer 4C. We also describe a distinct cortical target for 'blue-OFF' cells, whose afferents terminated in layer 4A and seemed patchy in organization. The more common 'blue-ON' afferents were found in 4A as well as lower layer 2/3. Chromatic information is thus conveyed to V1 by parallel, anatomically segregated colour-opponent systems, to be combined at a later stage of the colour circuit.},

The specialness of face processing is acknowledged in the artificial vision community, where contests for face-recognition algorithms abound. Neurological evidence strongly implicates a dedicated machinery for face processing in the human brain to explain the double dissociability of face- and object-recognition deficits. Furthermore, recent evidence shows that macaques too have specialized neural machinery for processing faces. Here we propose a unifying hypothesis, deduced from computational, neurological, fMRI, and single-unit experiments: that what makes face processing special is that it is gated by an obligatory detection process. We clarify this idea in concrete algorithmic terms and show how it can explain a variety of phenomena associated with face processing.},

abstract = {Information is integrated across the visual field to transform local features into a global percept. We now know that V1 neurons provide more spatial integration than originally thought due to the existence of their nonclassical inhibitory surrounds. To understand spatial integration in the visual cortex, we have studied the nature and extent of center and surround influences on neuronal response. We used drifting sinusoidal gratings in circular and annular apertures to estimate the sizes of the receptive field's excitatory center and suppressive surround. We used combinations of stimuli inside and outside the receptive field to explore the nature of the surround influence on the receptive field center as a function of the relative and absolute contrast of stimuli in the two regions. We conclude that the interaction is best explained as a divisive modulation of response gain by signals from the surround. We then develop a receptive field model based on the ratio of signals from Gaussian-shaped center and surround mechanisms. We show that this model can account well for the variations in receptive field size with contrast that we and others have observed and for variations in size with the state of contrast adaptation. The model achieves this success by simple variations in the relative gain of the two component mechanisms of the receptive field. This model thus offers a parsimonious explanation of a variety of phenomena involving changes in apparent receptive field size and accounts for these phenomena purely in terms of two receptive field mechanisms that do not themselves change in size. We used the extent of the center mechanism in our model as an indicator of the spatial extent of the central excitatory portion of the receptive field. We compared the extent of the center to measurements of horizontal connections within V1 and determined that horizontal intracortical connections are well matched in extent to the receptive field center mechanism. Input to the suppressive surround may come in part from feedback signals from higher areas.},

abstract = {This report describes a new electronic atlas of human cerebral cortex that provides a substrate for a wide variety of brain-mapping analyses. The Population-Average, Landmark- and Surface-based (PALS) atlas approach involves surface-based and volume-based representations of cortical shape, each available as population averages and as individual subject data. The specific PALS-B12 atlas introduced here is derived from structural MRI volumes of 12 normal young adults. Accurate cortical surface reconstructions were generated for each hemisphere, and the surfaces were inflated, flattened, and mapped to standard spherical configurations using SureFit and Caret software. A target atlas sphere was generated by averaging selected landmark contours from each of the 24 contributing hemispheres. Each individual hemisphere was deformed to this target using landmark-constrained surface registration. The utility of the resultant PALS-B12 atlas was demonstrated using a variety of analyses. (i) Probabilistic maps of sulcal identity were generated using both surface-based registration (SBR) and conventional volume-based registration (VBR). The SBR approach achieved markedly better consistency of sulcal alignment than did VBR. (ii) A method is introduced for 'multi-fiducial mapping' of volume-averaged group data (e.g., fMRI data, probabilistic architectonic maps) onto each individual hemisphere in the atlas, followed by spatial averaging across the individual maps. This yielded a population-average surface representation that circumvents the biases inherent in choosing any single hemisphere as a target. (iii) Surface-based and volume-based morphometry applied to maps of sulcal depth and sulcal identity demonstrated prominent left-right asymmetries in and near the superior temporal sulcus and Sylvian fissure. Moreover, shape variability in the temporal lobe is significantly greater in the left than the right hemisphere. The PALS-B12 atlas has been registered to other surface-based atlases to facilitate interchange of data and comparison across atlases. All data sets in the PALS-B12 atlas are accessible via the SumsDB database for online and offline visualization and analysis.},

abstract = {Perceptual bistability occurs when a physical stimulus gives rise to two distinct interpretations that alternate irregularly. Noise and adaptation processes are two possible mechanisms for switching in neuronal competition models that describe the alternating behaviors. Either of these processes, if strong enough, could alone cause the alternations in dominance. We examined their relative role in producing alternations by studying models where by smoothly varying the parameters, one can change the rhythmogenesis mechanism from being adaptation-driven to noise-driven. In consideration of the experimental constraints on the statistics of the alternations (mean and shape of the dominance duration distribution and correlations between successive durations) we ask whether we can rule out one of the mechanisms. We conclude that in order to comply with the observed mean of the dominance durations and their coefficient of variation, the models must operate within a balance between the noise and adaptation strength-both mechanisms are involved in producing alternations, in such a way that the system operates near the boundary between being adaptation-driven and noise-driven.},

@article{Wong2006,
abstract = {Recent physiological studies using behaving monkeys revealed that, in a two-alternative forced-choice visual motion discrimination task, reaction time was correlated with ramping of spike activity of lateral intraparietal cortical neurons. The ramping activity appears to reflect temporal accumulation, on a timescale of hundreds of milliseconds, of sensory evidence before a decision is reached. To elucidate the cellular and circuit basis of such integration times, we developed and investigated a simplified two-variable version of a biophysically realistic cortical network model of decision making. In this model, slow time integration can be achieved robustly if excitatory reverberation is primarily mediated by NMDA receptors; our model with only fast AMPA receptors at recurrent synapses produces decision times that are not comparable with experimental observations. Moreover, we found two distinct modes of network behavior, in which decision computation by winner-take-all competition is instantiated with or without attractor states for working memory. Decision process is closely linked to the local dynamics, in the "decision space" of the system, in the vicinity of an unstable saddle steady state that separates the basins of attraction for the two alternative choices. This picture provides a rigorous and quantitative explanation for the dependence of performance and response time on the degree of task difficulty, and the reason for which reaction times are longer in error trials than in correct trials as observed in the monkey experiment. Our reduced two-variable neural model offers a simple yet biophysically plausible framework for studying perceptual decision making in general.},

abstract = {The tendency to hear a tone sequence as 2 or more streams (segregated) builds up, but a sudden change in properties can reset the percept to 1 stream (integrated). This effect has not hitherto been explored using an objective measure of streaming. Stimuli comprised a 2.0-s fixed-frequency inducer followed by a 0.6-s test sequence of alternating pure tones (3 low [L]-high [H] cycles). Listeners compared intervals for which the test sequence was either isochronous or the H tones were slightly delayed. Resetting of segregation should make identifying the anisochronous interval easier. The HL frequency separation was varied (0-12 semitones), and properties of the inducer and test sequence were set to the same or different values. Inducer properties manipulated were frequency, number of onsets (several short bursts vs. one continuous tone), tone:silence ratio (short vs. extended bursts), level, and lateralization. All differences between the inducer and the L tones reduced temporal discrimination thresholds toward those for the no-inducer case, including properties shown previously not to affect segregation greatly. Overall, it is concluded that abrupt changes in a sequence cause resetting and improve subsequent temporal discrimination.},

abstract = {We propose a novel explanation for bistable perception, namely, the collective dynamics of multiple neural populations that are individually meta-stable. Distributed representations of sensory input and of perceptual state build gradually through noise-driven transitions in these populations, until the competition between alternative representations is resolved by a threshold mechanism. The perpetual repetition of this collective race to threshold renders perception bistable. This collective dynamics - which is largely uncoupled from the time-scales that govern individual populations or neurons - explains many hitherto puzzling observations about bistable perception: the wide range of mean alternation rates exhibited by bistable phenomena, the consistent variability of successive dominance periods, and the stabilizing effect of past perceptual states. It also predicts a number of previously unsuspected relationships between observable quantities characterizing bistable perception. We conclude that bistable perception reflects the collective nature of neural decision making rather than properties of individual populations or neurons.},

abstract = {Neural activity and perception are both affected by sensory history. The work presented here explores the relationship between the physiological effects of adaptation and their perceptual consequences. Perception is modeled as arising from an encoder-decoder cascade, in which the encoder is defined by the probabilistic response of a population of neurons, and the decoder transforms this population activity into a perceptual estimate. Adaptation is assumed to produce changes in the encoder, and we examine the conditions under which the decoder behavior is consistent with observed perceptual effects in terms of both bias and discriminability. We show that for all decoders, discriminability is bounded from below by the inverse Fisher information. Estimation bias, on the other hand, can arise for a variety of different reasons and can range from zero to substantial. We specifically examine biases that arise when the decoder is fixed, "unaware" of the changes in the encoding population (as opposed to "aware" of the adaptation and changing accordingly). We simulate the effects of adaptation on two well-studied sensory attributes, motion direction and contrast, assuming a gain change description of encoder adaptation. Although we cannot uniquely constrain the source of decoder bias, we find for both motion and contrast that an "unaware" decoder that maximizes the likelihood of the percept given by the preadaptation encoder leads to predictions that are consistent with behavioral data. This model implies that adaptation-induced biases arise as a result of temporary suboptimality of the decoder.},

abstract = {Neurons in the deeper layers of the superior colliculus (SC) have spatially tuned receptive fields that are arranged to form a map of auditory space. The spatial tuning of these neurons emerges gradually in an experience-dependent manner after the onset of hearing, but the relative contributions of peripheral and central factors in this process of maturation are unknown. We have studied the postnatal development of the projection to the ferret SC from the nucleus of the brachium of the inferior colliculus (nBIC), its main source of auditory input, to determine whether the emergence of auditory map topography can be attributed to anatomical rewiring of this projection. The pattern of retrograde labeling produced by injections of fluorescent microspheres in the SC on postnatal day (P) 0 and just after the age of hearing onset (P29), showed that the nBIC-SC projection is topographically organized in the rostrocaudal axis, along which sound azimuth is represented, from birth. Injections of biotinylated dextran amine-fluorescein into the nBIC at different ages (P30, 60, and 90) labeled axons with numerous terminals and en passant boutons throughout the deeper layers of the SC. This labeling covered the entire mediolateral extent of the SC, but, in keeping with the pattern of retrograde labeling following microsphere injections in the SC, was more restricted rostrocaudally. No systematic changes were observed with age. The stability of the nBIC-SC projection over this period suggests that developmental changes in auditory spatial tuning involve other processes, rather than a gross refinement of the projection from the nBIC.},

abstract = {The ability to represent and recognize naturally occuring sounds such as speech depends not only on spectral analysis carried out by the subcortical auditory system but also on the ability of the cortex to bind spectral information over time. In primates, these temporal binding processes are mirrored as selective responsiveness of neurons to species-specific vocalizations. Here, we used computational modeling of auditory cortex to investigate how selectivity to spectrally and temporally complex stimuli is achieved. A set of 208 microcolumns were arranged in a serial core-belt-parabelt structure documented in both humans and animals. Stimulus material comprised multiple consonant-vowel (CV) pseudowords. Selectivity to the spectral structure of the sounds was commonly found in all regions of the model (N = 122 columns out of 208), and this selectivity was only weakly affected by manipulating the structure and dynamics of the model. In contrast, temporal binding was rarer (N = 39), found mostly in the belt and parabelt regions. Thus, the serial core-belt-parabelt structure of auditory cortex is necessary for temporal binding. Further, adaptation due to synaptic depression-rendering the cortical network malleable by stimulus history-was crucial for the emergence of neurons sensitive to the temporal structure of the stimuli. Both spectral selectivity and temporal binding required that a sufficient proportion of the columns interacted in an inhibitory manner. The model and its structural modifications had a small-world structure (i.e., columns formed clusters and were within short node-to-node distances from each other). However, simulations showed that a small-world structure is not a necessary condition for spectral selectivity and temporal binding to emerge. In summary, this study suggests that temporal binding arises out of (1) the serial structure typical to the auditory cortex, (2) synaptic adaptation, and (3) inhibitory interactions between microcolumns.},

abstract = {There exists a common view that the brain acts like a Turing machine: The machine reads information from an infinite tape (sensory data) and, on the basis of the machine's state and information from the tape, an action (decision) is made. The main problem with this model lies in how to synchronize a large number of tapes in an adaptive way so that the machine is able to accomplish tasks such as object classification. We propose that such mechanisms exist already in the eye. A popular view is that the retina, typically associated with high gain and adaptation for light processing, is actually performing local preprocessing by means of its center-surround receptive field. We would like to show another property of the retina: The ability to integrate many independent processes. We believe that this integration is implemented by synchronization of neuronal oscillations. In this paper, we present a model of the retina consisting of a series of coupled oscillators which can synchronize on several scales. Synchronization is an analog process which is converted into a digital spike train in the output of the retina. We have developed a hardware implementation of this model, which enables us to carry out rapid simulation of multineuron oscillatory dynamics. We show that the properties of the spike trains in our model are similar to those found in vivo in the cat retina.},

abstract = {In a previous paper, it was shown that sequential stream segregation could be based on both spectral information and periodicity information, if listeners were encouraged to hear segregation [Vliegen and Oxenham, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 105, 339-346 (1999)]. The present paper investigates whether segregation based on periodicity information alone also occurs when the task requires integration. This addresses the question: Is segregation based on periodicity automatic and obligatory? A temporal discrimination task was used, as there is evidence that it is difficult to compare the timing of auditory events that are perceived as being in different perceptual streams. An ABA ABA ABA... sequence was used, in which tone B could be either exactly at the temporal midpoint between two successive tones A or slightly delayed. The tones A and B were of three types: (1) both pure tones; (2) both complex tones filtered through a fixed passband so as to contain only harmonics higher than the 10th, thereby eliminating detectable spectral differences, where only the fundamental frequency (f0) was varied between tones A and B; and (3) both complex tones with the same f0, but where the center frequency of the spectral passband varied between tones. Tone A had a fixed frequency of 300 Hz (when A and B were pure tones) or a fundamental frequency (f0) of 100 Hz (when A and B were complex tones). Five different intervals, ranging from 1 to 18 semitones, were used. The results for all three conditions showed that shift thresholds increased with increasing interval between tones A and B, but the effect was largest for the conditions where A and B differed in spectrum (i.e., the pure-tone and the variable-center-frequency conditions). The results suggest that spectral information is dominant in inducing (involuntary) segregation, but periodicity information can also play a role.},

abstract = {The cochlear amplifier is a nonlinear active process providing the mammalian ear with its extraordinary sensitivity, large dynamic range and sharp frequency tuning. While there is much evidence that amplification results from active force generation by mechanosensory hair cells, there is debate about the cellular processes behind nonlinear amplification. Outer hair cell electromotility has been suggested to underlie the cochlear amplifier. However, it has been shown in frog and turtle that spontaneous movements of hair bundles endow them with a nonlinear response with increased sensitivity that could be the basis of amplification. The present work shows that the properties of the cochlear amplifier could be understood as resulting from the combination of both hair bundle motility and electromotility in an integrated system that couples these processes through the geometric arrangement of hair cells embedded in the cochlear partition. In this scenario, the cochlear partition can become a dynamic oscillator which in the vicinity of a Hopf bifurcation exhibits all the key properties of the cochlear amplifier. The oscillatory behavior and the nonlinearity are provided by active hair bundles. Electromotility is largely linear but produces an additional feedback that allows hair bundle movements to couple to basilar membrane vibrations.},

abstract = {As sensory cells, hair cells within the mammalian inner ear convert sounds into receptor potentials when their projecting stereocilia are deflected. The organ of Corti of the cochlea contains two types of hair cell, inner and outer hair cells, which differ in function. It has been appreciated for over two decades that although inner hair cells act as the primary receptor cell for the auditory system, the outer hair cells can also act as motor cells. Outer hair cells respond to variation in potential, and change length at rates unequalled by other motile cells. The forces generated by outer hair cells are capable of altering the delicate mechanics of the cochlear partition, increasing hearing sensitivity and frequency selectivity. The discovery of such hair-cell motility has modified the view of the cochlea as a simple frequency analyser into one where it is an active non-linear filter that allows only the prominent features of acoustic signals to be transmitted to the acoustic nerve by the inner hair cells. In this view, such frequency selectivity arises through the suppression of adjacent frequencies, a mechanical effect equivalent to lateral inhibition in neural structures. These processes are explained by the interplay between the hydrodynamic interactions among different parts of the cochlear partition and the effective non-linear behaviour of the cell motor.},

abstract = {Dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra provide one of the major neuromodulatory inputs to the neostriatum. Recent in situ hybridization experiments have suggested that postsynaptic dopamine receptors are segregated in striatonigral and striatopallidal neurons. We have tested this hypothesis in acutely isolated, retrogradely labeled striatonigral neurons by examining the neuromodulatory effects of selective dopaminergic agonists on Na currents and by probing single-cell antisense RNA populations with dopamine receptor cDNAs. In most of the neurons examined (20/31), the application of the D1 dopamine receptor agonist SKF 38393 reduced evoked whole-cell Na+ current. The D2 agonists quinpirole and bromocriptine had mixed effects; in most neurons (23/42), whole-cell Na+ currents were reduced, but in others (8/42), currents were increased. In cell-attached patch recordings, bath application of SKF 38393 decreased currents as in whole-cell recordings, whereas quinpirole consistently (6/10) enhanced currents--suggesting that D2-like receptors could act through membrane delimited and non-delimited pathways. Changes in evoked current were produced by modulation of peak conductance and modest shifts in the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation. Antisense RNA probes of dopamine receptor cDNA Southern blots consistently (5/5) revealed the presence of D1, D2, and D3 receptor mRNA in single striatonigral neurons. These findings argue that, contrary to a strict receptor segregation hypothesis, many striatonigral neurons colocalize functional D1, D2, and D3 receptors.},

abstract = {There is controversy over whether stream segregation is an attention-dependent process. Part of the argument is related to the initial formation of auditory streams. It has been suggested that attention is needed only to form the streams, but not to maintain them once they have been segregated. The question of whether covert attention at the beginning of a to-be-ignored set of sounds will be enough to initiate the segregation process remains open. Here, we investigate this question by (1) using a methodology that does not require the participant to make an overt response to assess how the unattended sounds are organized and (2) structuring the test sound sequence to account for the covert attention explanation. The results of four experiments provide evidence to support the view that attention is not always required for the formation of auditory streams.},

abstract = {A computational model was developed for the responses of low-frequency auditory-nerve (AN) fibers in cat. The goal was to produce realistic temporal response properties and average discharge rates in response to simple and complex stimuli. Temporal and average-rate properties of AN responses change as a function of sound-pressure level due to nonlinearities in the auditory periphery. The input stage of the AN model is a narrow-band filter that simulates the mechanical tuning of the basilar membrane. The parameters of this filter vary continuously as a function of stimulus level via a feedback mechanism, simulating the compressive nonlinearity associated with the mechanics of the basilar membrane. A memoryless, saturating nonlinearity and two low-pass filters simulate transduction and membrane properties of the inner hair cell (IHC). A diffusion model for the IHC-AN synapse introduces adaptation. Finally, a nonhomogeneous Poisson process, modified by absolute and relative refractoriness, provides the output discharge times. Responses to several different stimuli are presented. These responses illustrate nonlinear temporal response properties that cannot be achieved with linear models for AN fibers.},

abstract = {Low-frequency sound localization depends on the neural computation of interaural time differences (ITD) and relies on neurons in the auditory brain stem that integrate synaptic inputs delivered by the ipsi- and contralateral auditory pathways that start at the two ears. The first auditory neurons that respond selectively to ITD are found in the medial superior olivary nucleus (MSO). We identified a new mechanism for ITD coding using a brain slice preparation that preserves the binaural inputs to the MSO. There was an internal latency difference for the two excitatory pathways that would, if left uncompensated, position the ITD response function too far outside the physiological range to be useful for estimating ITD. We demonstrate, and support using a biophysically based computational model, that a bilateral asymmetry in excitatory post-synaptic potential (EPSP) slopes provides a robust compensatory delay mechanism due to differential activation of low threshold potassium conductance on these inputs and permits MSO neurons to encode physiological ITDs. We suggest, more generally, that the dependence of spike probability on rate of depolarization, as in these auditory neurons, provides a mechanism for temporal order discrimination between EPSPs.},

V1 transforms information received from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and distributes it to separate domains in V2 for transmission to higher visual areas. During the past 20 years, schemes for the functional organization of V1 and V2 have been based on a tripartite framework developed by Livingstone {\&} Hubel (1988) . Since then, new anatomical data have accumulated concerning V1's input, its internal circuitry, and its output to V2. These new data, along with physiological and imaging studies, now make it likely that the visual attributes of color, form, and motion are not neatly segregated by V1 into different stripe compartments in V2. Instead, there are just two main streams, originating from cytochrome oxidase patches and interpatches, that project to V2. Each stream is composed of a mixture of magno, parvo, and konio geniculate signals. Further studies are required to elucidate how the patches and interpatches differ in the output they convey to extrastriate cortex.},

We have developed a sensitive imaging system in the Drosophila brain that couples two-photon microscopy with the specific expression of the calcium-sensitive fluorescent protein, G-CaMP. At natural odor concentration, each odor elicits a distinct and sparse spatial pattern of activity in the antennal lobe that is conserved in different flies. Patterns of glomerular activity are similar upon imaging of sensory and projection neurons, suggesting the faithful transmission of sensory input to higher brain centers. Finally, we demonstrate that the response pattern of a given glomerulus is a function of the specificity of a single odorant receptor. The development of this imaging system affords an opportunity to monitor activity in defined neurons throughout the fly brain with high sensitivity and excellent spatial resolution.},

abstract = {The mismatch negativity (MMN), a component of event-related potentials (ERP), was used to investigate the effect of attention on auditory stream segregation. Subjects were presented with sequences of alternating high and low tones that occurred at a constant rate, which they ignored. When subjects ignored the stimuli, the three-tone standard and deviant sequences contained within the high- and low-pitched tones did not emerge and no MMNs were obtained. Subjects were then instructed to attend to the high-pitched tones of the stimulus sequences and detect the within-stream deviants. When subjects selectively attended the high-pitched tones, MMNs were obtained to the deviants within both the attended and unattended streams. These results indicate that attention can produce segregation such that the sequences of low- and high-pitched tones are available to the automatic deviance detection system that underlies the generation of the MMN. Selective attention can alter the organization of sensory input in the early stages of acoustic processing.},

@article{Bourgeois1989,
abstract = {We used quantitative electron microscopy to determine the effect of precocious visual experience on the time course, magnitude, and pattern of perinatal synaptic overproduction in the primary visual cortex of the rhesus monkey. Fetuses were delivered by caesarean section 3 weeks before term, exposed to normal light intensity and day/night cycles, and killed within the first postnatal month, together with age-matched controls that were delivered at term. We found that premature visual stimulation does not affect the rate of synaptic accretion and overproduction. Both of these processes proceed in relation to the time of conception rather than to the time of delivery. In contrast, the size, type, and laminar distribution of synapses were significantly different between preterm and control infants. The changes and differences in these parameters correlate with the duration of visual stimulation and become less pronounced with age. If visual experience in infancy influences the maturation of the visual cortex, it must do so predominantly by strengthening, modifying, and/or eliminating synapses that have already been formed, rather than by regulating the rate of synapse production.},

We performed fMRI experiments to identify neuronal activity in the human brain selective for pattern motion. A protocol using adaptation to moving 'plaid' stimuli allowed us to separate pattern-motion responses from other types of motion-related activity within the same brain structures, and revealed strong pattern-motion selectivity in human visual area MT+. Reducing the perceptual coherence of the plaids yielded a corresponding decrease in pattern-motion responsivity, providing evidence that percepts of coherent motion are closely linked to the activity of pattern-motion cells in human MT+.},

@article{Pallas1994,
abstract = {Specific neonatal lesions in ferrets can induce retinal axons to project into the medial geniculate nucleus (MGN). In the accompanying paper (Pallas et al., this issue), we described the morphology of these retinal ganglion cell axons. Those results and others (Roe et al. [1993] J. Comp. Neurol. 334:263) suggest that these axons belong to the W class of retinal axons. In this paper, the retino-MGN axons are compared with the normal inputs to the MGN from the brachium of the inferior colliculus (BIC). We first sought to determine further the extent to which a novel target might influence retinal axon arbor morphology. The second issue concerns retinal topography. Ferrets with retinal projections to the MGN have a two-dimensional retinotopic map in the MGN and the primary auditory cortex rather than the one-dimensional tonotopic map normally present (Roe et al. [1990] Science 250:818). To investigate whether there might be an anatomical substrate for a two-dimensional retinotopic map in the MGN, we compared the space-filling characteristics of the retino-MGN axons with the IC-MGN axons. Our results show that the branched retino-MGN axons resemble normal retinal W axons much more closely than they resemble the normal inputs to MGN. In addition, most of the axon arbors from the BIC are elongated along the rostrocaudal (isofrequency) axis, whereas the branched retino-MGN axons are more spatially restricted, suggesting an anatomical substrate for a retinotopic map in the MGN of the rewired ferrets.},

abstract = {Elucidation of the neural substrates underlying complex animal behaviors depends on precise activity control tools, as well as compatible readout methods. Recent developments in optogenetics have addressed this need, opening up new possibilities for systems neuroscience. Interrogation of even deep neural circuits can be conducted by directly probing the necessity and sufficiency of defined circuit elements with millisecond-scale, cell type-specific optical perturbations, coupled with suitable readouts such as electrophysiology, optical circuit dynamics measures and freely moving behavior in mammals. Here we collect in detail our strategies for delivering microbial opsin genes to deep mammalian brain structures in vivo, along with protocols for integrating the resulting optical control with compatible readouts (electrophysiological, optical and behavioral). The procedures described here, from initial virus preparation to systems-level functional readout, can be completed within 4-5 weeks. Together, these methods may help in providing circuit-level insight into the dynamics underlying complex mammalian behaviors in health and disease.},

abstract = {Santiago Ram{\'{o}}n y Cajal described a number of somatosensory structures, including several associated with pain, in his major work on the Histology of the Nervous System of Man and Vertebrates. Our knowledge of such structures has been considerably expanded since Cajal because of the introduction of a number of experimental approaches that were not available in his time. For example, Cajal made several drawings of peripheral mechanoreceptors, as well as of bare nerve endings, but later work by others described additional somatosensory receptors and investigated the ultrastructure of bare nerve endings. Furthermore, the transducer molecules responsible for responses to nociceptive, thermal or chemical stimuli are now becoming known, including a series of TRP (transient receptor potential) receptor molecules, such as TRPV1 (the capsaicin receptor). Cajal described the development of dorsal root and other sensory ganglion cells and related the disposition of their somata and neurites to his theory of the functional polarity of neurons. He described the entry of both large and small afferent fibers into the spinal cord, including the projections of their collaterals into different parts of the gray matter and into different white matter tracts. He described a number of types of neurons in the gray matter, including ones in the marginal zone, substantia gelatinosa and head and neck of the dorsal horn. He found neurons in the deep dorsal horn whose dendrites extend dorsally into the superficial dorsal horn. Some of these neurons have since been shown by retrograde labeling to be spinothalamic tract cells. Cajal clearly described the dorsal column/medial lemniscus pathway, but the presence and course of the spinothalamic tract was unknown at the time.},

Thus, pinwheel centres truly represent singularities in the cortical map. This highly ordered arrangement at the level of single cells suggests great precision in the development of cortical circuits underlying orientation selectivity.},

abstract = {Previous claims that auditory stream segregation occurs in cochlear implant listeners are based on limited evidence. In experiment 1, eight listeners heard tones presented in a 30-s repeating ABA-sequence, with frequencies matching the centre frequencies of the implant's 22 electrodes. Tone A always stimulated electrode 11 (centre of the array); tone B stimulated one of the others. Tone repetition times (TRTs) from 50 to 200 ms were used. Listeners reported when they heard one or two streams. The proportion of time that each sequence was reported as segregated was consistently greater with increased electrode separation. However, TRT had no significant effect, and the perceptual reversals typical of normal-hearing listeners rarely occurred. The results may reflect channel discrimination rather than stream segregation. In experiment 2, six listeners performed a pitch-ranking task using tone pairs (reference=electrode 11). Listeners reported which tone was higher in pitch (or brighter in timbre) and their confidence in the pitch judgement. Similarities were observed in the individual pattern of results for reported segregation and pitch discrimination. Many implant listeners may show little or no sign of automatic stream segregation owing to the reduced perceptual space within which sounds can differ from one another.},

abstract = {Traditionally, prejudice has been conceptualized as simple animosity. The stereotype content model (SCM) shows that some prejudice is worse. The SCM previously demonstrated separate stereotype dimensions of warmth (low-high) and competence (low-high), identifying four distinct out-group clusters. The SCM predicts that only extreme out-groups, groups that are both stereotypically hostile and stereotypically incompetent (low warmth, low competence), such as addicts and the homeless, will be dehumanized. Prior studies show that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is necessary for social cognition. Functional magnetic resonance imaging provided data for examining brain activations in 10 participants viewing 48 photographs of social groups and 12 participants viewing objects; each picture dependably represented one SCM quadrant. Analyses revealed mPFC activation to all social groups except extreme (low-low) out-groups, who especially activated insula and amygdala, a pattern consistent with disgust, the emotion predicted by the SCM. No objects, though rated with the same emotions, activated the mPFC. This neural evidence supports the prediction that extreme out-groups may be perceived as less than human, or dehumanized.},

abstract = {The central nucleus of the inferior colliculus in the cat is distinguished by its unique neuropil. In Golgi-impregnated material, it is composed primarily of neurons with disc-shaped dendritic fields arranged into parallel arrays, or laminae, complemented by the laminar afferent axons from the lateral lemniscus. Large, medium-large, medium, and small varieties of disc-shaped cells are distinguished on the basis of the size of the dendritic field and cell body size, dendritic diameter, and dendritic appendages. A second major class of neurons in the central nucleus are the stellate cells with dichotomously branched, spherical-shaped dendritic trees. Simple, complex, and small stellate cells can be distinguished by their size and by the complexity of the dendritic and axonal branching. Laminar afferent axons are recognized by the nests of collateral side branches and the grapelike clusters of terminal boutons--thick, thin, and intermediate-sized varieties are apparent. Other axon types include local collaterals of central nucleus neurons, some of which are distinguished by their frequent and complex collaterals. In the central nucleus, the configuration of the fibrodendritic laminae, the presence of subdivisions, and the banding of afferent axons suggest levels of organization which are superimposed on the synaptic arrangements of the individual cell and axon types. The laminar pattern, as studied in serial Golgi-impregnated sections, differs from previous reports. The central nucleus contains subdivisions which can be distinguished by their laminar pattern, different proportions of cell types, and the packing density of the cell bodies and axonal plexus. The patterns of degeneration observed in Nauta-stained material after lesions of caudal auditory pathways show that thick and fine afferent fibers form dense bands of degeneration separated by sparse, fine-fiber degeneration. The bands are thicker than individual laminae but smaller than the subdivisions. The intrinsic organization of the neurons and axons, combined with the laminar organization, subdivisions, and banding patterns, each may contribute different aspects to the processing of auditory information in the central nucleus.},

abstract = {Audible frequencies of sound are encoded in a continuous manner along the length of the cochlea, and frequency is transmitted to the brain as a representation of place on the basilar membrane. The resulting tonotopic map has been assumed to be a continuous smooth progression from low to high frequency throughout the central auditory system. Here, physiological and anatomical data show that best frequency is represented in a discontinuous manner in the inferior colliculus, the major auditory structure of the midbrain. Multiunit maps demonstrate a distinct stepwise organization in the order of best frequency progression. Furthermore, independent data from single neurons show that best frequencies at octave intervals of approximately one-third are more prevalent than others. These data suggest that, in the inferior colliculus, there is a defined space of tissue devoted to a given frequency, and input within this frequency band may be pooled for higher-level processing.},

abstract = {Auditory stream segregation (or streaming) is a phenomenon in which 2 or more repeating sounds differing in at least 1 acoustic attribute are perceived as 2 or more separate sound sources (i.e., streams). This article selectively reviews psychophysical and computational studies of streaming and comprehensively reviews more recent neurophysiological studies that have provided important insights into the mechanisms of streaming. On the basis of these studies, segregation of sounds is likely to occur beginning in the auditory periphery and continuing at least to primary auditory cortex for simple cues such as pure-tone frequency but at stages as high as secondary auditory cortex for more complex cues such as periodicity pitch. Attention-dependent and perception-dependent processes are likely to take place in primary or secondary auditory cortex and may also involve higher level areas outside of auditory cortex. Topographic maps of acoustic attributes, stimulus-specific suppression, and competition between representations are among the neurophysiological mechanisms that likely contribute to streaming. A framework for future research is proposed.},

@article{Shneiderman1988,
abstract = {This study examines the dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus (DNLL) and its afferent and efferent connections. In Nissl-stained material, DNLL has three parts: dorsal, ventral, and lateral. Although each part contains neurons with similar Nissl patterns, the subdivisions may be distinguished by the size, shape, and orientation of the cells. The lateral DNLL contains a mixture of DNLL neurons and cells from the sagulum. Afferent connections to DNLL were investigated with anterograde axonal transport techniques. Bilateral inputs to DNLL arise from the anteroventral cochlear nucleus and lateral superior olive, while unilateral inputs are provided by the ipsilateral medial superior olive and the contralateral DNLL. The inputs appear to have a tonotopic organization. Afferent fibers to DNLL form horizontal bands that are continuous both mediolaterally and rostrocaudally. All parts of DNLL do not share the same inputs, and a medial-to-lateral gradient in the labeling of some pathways is evident. To study the efferent connections of DNLL, both retrograde and anterograde axonal transport techniques were used. The DNLL projects to the inferior colliculus and the contralateral DNLL. The topography of these projections suggests that areas of similar tonotopic organization are connected. In the inferior colliculus, the projection is heaviest to the central nucleus and extends to the adjacent dorsal and caudal cortex, the rostral pole nucleus, and the ventrolateral nucleus. Axons from DNLL terminate along the fibrodendritic laminae of the central nucleus as bands that are prominent on the contralateral side, whereas those on the ipsilateral colliculus are more diffuse. The afferent and efferent connections of DNLL constitute a multisynaptic pathway, parallel to the other ascending pathways to the inferior colliculus. The other ascending pathways include the direct pathways from the cochlear nucleus to the inferior colliculus and the indirect pathways via the superior olivary complex. Ascending pathways are discussed as to their relationship to the subdivisions of the inferior colliculus, the laterality of their projections, and their banding patterns in the central nucleus. In contrast to the excitatory pathways to the inferior colliculus, the neurons in DNLL may use GABA as a neurotransmitter. Axons from the DNLL terminate in the inferior colliculus as bands that could have a unique inhibitory function. Thus, the multisynaptic, DNLL pathway may provide feed-forward inhibitory inputs to the inferior colliculus, bilaterally, and to the contralateral DNLL.},

abstract = {Since its development about 15 years ago, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has become the leading research tool for mapping brain activity. The technique works by detecting the levels of oxygen in the blood, point by point, throughout the brain. In other words, it relies on a surrogate signal, resulting from changes in oxygenation, blood volume and flow, and does not directly measure neural activity. Although a relationship between changes in brain activity and blood flow has long been speculated, indirectly examined and suggested and surely anticipated and expected, the neural basis of the fMRI signal was only recently demonstrated directly in experiments using combined imaging and intracortical recordings. In the present paper, we discuss the results obtained from such combined experiments. We also discuss our current knowledge of the extracellularly measured signals of the neural processes that they represent and of the structural and functional neurovascular coupling, which links such processes with the hemodynamic changes that offer the surrogate signal that we use to map brain activity. We conclude by considering applications of invasive MRI, including injections of paramagnetic tracers for the study of connectivity in the living animal and simultaneous imaging and electrical microstimulation.},

Using a task adapted from Bregman and Rudnicky's (1975) study and implemented in a conditioned head-turn procedure, infant and adult listeners had to discriminate the temporal order of 2200 and 2400 Hz target tones presented alone, preceded and followed by 1460 Hz flanker tones, and presented within a series of 1460 Hz captor tones meant to release the target tones from the effects of the flankers by capturing the flankers into a separate stream. Infants showed the same pattern of discrimination across conditions as adults: discrimination of target tones in the target-alone condition, a decrease in performance when flanker tones were introduced, and a return to target-alone level in the captor condition. These results suggest that infants' perceptual organization of tones is similar to that of adults, and that their ability to selectively attend to target sounds and ignore distractors depends on the structural properties and perceptual organization of the non-target sounds.},

abstract = {Auditory stream segregation involves linking temporally separate acoustic events into one or more coherent sequences. For any non-trivial sequence of sounds, many alternative descriptions can be formed, only one or very few of which emerge in awareness at any time. Evidence from studies showing bi-/multistability in auditory streaming suggest that some, perhaps many of the alternative descriptions are represented in the brain in parallel and that they continuously vie for conscious perception. Here, based on a predictive coding view, we consider the nature of these sound representations and how they compete with each other. Predictive processing helps to maintain perceptual stability by signalling the continuation of previously established patterns as well as the emergence of new sound sources. It also provides a measure of how well each of the competing representations describes the current acoustic scene. This account of auditory stream segregation has been tested on perceptual data obtained in the auditory streaming paradigm.},

Only participants who shifted attention toward the irrelevant channel during the backward speech later recalled hearing it. In those whose attention shifted, shadowing errors peaked dramatically about 15 s after the change. There was no evidence of direct or indirect memory for phrases presented in the irrelevant channel. The results contradict models of attention stating that listeners process task-irrelevant information extensively without diverting resources used in shadowing.},

Whole-head MEG systems readily facilitate detailed spatiotemporal characterization of language processes. A fair amount of information is available about the cortical sequence of word perception and comprehension in the auditory and visual domain, which can be applied for clinical use. Language production remains, at present, somewhat less well charted. In clinical practice, the most obvious needs are noninvasive evaluation of the language-dominant hemisphere and mapping of areas involved in language performance to assist surgery. Multiple experimental designs and analysis approaches have been proposed for estimation of language lateralization. Some of them have been compared with the invasive Wada test and need to be tested further. Development of approaches for more comprehensive pre-surgical characterization of language cortex should build on basic neuroscience research, making use of parametric designs that allow functional mapping. Studies of the neural basis of developmental and acquired language disorders, such as dyslexia, stuttering, and aphasia can currently be regarded more as clinical or basic neuroscience research rather than as clinical routine. Such investigations may eventually provide tools for development of individually targeted training procedures and their objective evaluation.},

However, experimental and theoretical developments of the past 20 years force one to re-evaluate its usefulness. First, the H-H model is, in its original form, limited to the two voltage-dependent currents found in the squid giant axon and it must be extended significantly if it is to deal with the excitable soma and dendrites of neurons. Second, the macroscopic and deterministic H-H model does not capture correctly the kinetics of the Na(+) channel and it cannot account for the stochastic response to current injection that arises from the discrete nature of ion channels. Third, much simpler integrate-and-fire-type models seem to be more useful for exploring collective phenomena in neuronal networks. Is the H-H model threatened, or will it continue to set the fundamental framework for exploring neuronal excitability?},

abstract = {Mycobacterium tuberculosis encodes five type VII secretion systems that are responsible for exporting a number of proteins, including members of the Esx family, which have been linked to tuberculosis pathogenesis and survival within host cells. The gene cluster encoding ESX-3 is regulated by the availability of iron and zinc, and secreted protein products such as the EsxG{\textperiodcentered}EsxH complex have been associated with metal ion acquisition. EsxG and EsxH have previously been shown to form a stable 1:1 heterodimeric complex, and here we report the solution structure of the complex, which features a core four-helix bundle decorated at both ends by long, highly flexible, N- and C-terminal arms that contain a number of highly conserved residues. Despite clear similarities in the overall backbone fold to the EsxA{\textperiodcentered}EsxB complex, the structure reveals some striking differences in surface features, including a potential protein interaction site on the surface of the EsxG{\textperiodcentered}EsxH complex. EsxG{\textperiodcentered}EsxH was also found to contain a specific Zn(2+) binding site formed from a cluster of histidine residues on EsxH, which are conserved across obligate mycobacterial pathogens including M. tuberculosis and Mycobacterium leprae. This site may reflect an essential role in zinc ion acquisition or point to Zn(2+)-dependent regulation of its interaction with functional partner proteins. Overall, the surface features of both the EsxG{\textperiodcentered}EsxH and the EsxA{\textperiodcentered}EsxB complexes suggest functions mediated via interactions with one or more target protein partners.},

abstract = {The auditory scene is dynamic, changing from 1 min to the next as sound sources enter and leave our space. How does the brain resolve the problem of maintaining neural representations of the distinct yet changing sound sources? We used an auditory streaming paradigm to test the dynamics of multiple sound source representation, when switching between integrated and segregated sound streams. The mismatch negativity (MMN) component of event-related potentials was used as index of change detection to observe stimulus-driven modulation of the ongoing sound organization. Probe tones were presented randomly within ambiguously organized sound sequences to reveal whether the neurophysiological representation of the sounds was integrated (no MMN) or segregated (MMN). The pattern of results demonstrated context-dependent responses to a single tone that was modulated in dynamic fashion as the auditory environment rapidly changed from integrated to segregated sounds. This suggests a rapid form of auditory plasticity in which the longer-term sound context influences the current state of neural activity when it is ambiguous. These results demonstrate stimulus-driven modulation of neural activity that accommodates to the dynamically changing acoustic environment.},

abstract = {In the present study, we examine the activity patterns of and synaptic inputs to Renshaw cells (RCs) during fictive locomotion in the newborn mouse using visually guided recordings from GABAergic cells expressing glutamic acid decarboxylase 67-green fluorescent protein (GFP). Among the GFP-positive neurons in the lumbar ventral horn, RCs were uniquely identified as receiving ventral root-evoked short-latency EPSPs that were markedly reduced in amplitude by nicotinic receptor blockers mecamylamine or tubocurarine. During locomotor-like rhythmic activity evoked by bath application of 5-HT and NMDA, 50{\%} of the recorded RCs fired in-phase with the ipsilateral L2 flexor-related rhythm, whereas the rest fired in the extensor phase. Each population of RCs fired throughout the corresponding locomotor phase. All RCs received both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs during the locomotor-like rhythmic activity. Blocking nicotinic receptors with mecamylamine markedly reduced the rhythmic excitatory drive, indicating that these rhythmic inputs originate mainly from motor neurons (MNs). Inhibitory synaptic inputs persisted in the presence of the nicotinic blocker. Part of this inhibitory drive and remaining excitatory drive could be from commissural interneurons because the present study also shows that RCs receive direct crossed inhibitory and excitatory synaptic inputs. However, rhythmic synaptic inputs in RCs were also observed in hemicord preparations in the presence of mecamylamine. These results show that, during locomotor activity, RC firing properties are modulated not only by MNs but also by the ipsilateral and contralateral locomotor networks.},

@article{Pressnitzer2011a,
abstract = {In this review paper aimed at the non-specialist, we explore the use that neuroscientists and musicians have made of perceptual illusions based on ambiguity. The pivotal issue is auditory scene analysis (ASA), or what enables us to make sense of complex acoustic mixtures in order to follow, for instance, a single melody in the midst of an orchestra. In general, ASA uncovers the most likely physical causes that account for the waveform collected at the ears. However, the acoustical problem is ill-posed and it must be solved from noisy sensory input. Recently, the neural mechanisms implicated in the transformation of ambiguous sensory information into coherent auditory scenes have been investigated using so-called bistability illusions (where an unchanging ambiguous stimulus evokes a succession of distinct percepts in the mind of the listener). After reviewing some of those studies, we turn to music, which arguably provides some of the most complex acoustic scenes that a human listener will ever encounter. Interestingly, musicians will not always aim at making each physical source intelligible, but rather express one or more melodic lines with a small or large number of instruments. By means of a few musical illustrations and by using a computational model inspired by neuro-physiological principles, we suggest that this relies on a detailed (if perhaps implicit) knowledge of the rules of ASA and of its inherent ambiguity. We then put forward the opinion that some degree perceptual ambiguity may participate in our appreciation of music.},

@article{Mountcastle1997,
abstract = {The modular organization of nervous systems is a widely documented principle of design for both vertebrate and invertebrate brains of which the columnar organization of the neocortex is an example. The classical cytoarchitectural areas of the neocortex are composed of smaller units, local neural circuits repeated iteratively within each area. Modules may vary in cell type and number, in internal and external connectivity, and in mode of neuronal processing between different large entities; within any single large entity they have a basic similarity of internal design and operation. Modules are most commonly grouped into entities by sets of dominating external connections. This unifying factor is most obvious for the heterotypical sensory and motor areas of the neocortex. Columnar defining factors in homotypical areas are generated, in part, within the cortex itself. The set of all modules composing such an entity may be fractionated into different modular subsets by different extrinsic connections. Linkages between them and subsets in other large entities form distributed systems. The neighborhood relations between connected subsets of modules in different entities result in nested distributed systems that serve distributed functions. A cortical area defined in classical cytoarchitectural terms may belong to more than one and sometimes to several distributed systems. Columns in cytoarchitectural areas located at some distance from one another, but with some common properties, may be linked by long-range, intracortical connections.},

abstract = {Studies using functional neuroimaging and patient populations have demonstrated that distinct brain regions subserve semantic knowledge for different classes of inanimate objects (e.g., tools, musical instruments, and houses). What this work has yet to consider, however, is how conceptual knowledge about people may be organized in the brain. In particular, is there a distinct functional neuroanatomy associated with person knowledge? By using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we measured neural activity while participants made semantic judgments about people or objects. A unique pattern of brain activity was associated with person judgments and included brain regions previously implicated in other aspects of social-cognitive functioning: medial prefrontal cortex, superior temporal cortex, intraparietal sulcus, and fusiform gyrus. These regions were generally marked by relatively little change from baseline brain activity for person judgments along with significant deactivations for object judgments. Together, these findings support the notion that person knowledge may be functionally dissociable from other classes of semantic knowledge within the brain.},

All stimuli were carefully loudness-balanced prior to the experiments. The cochlear electrode location of A was fixed, while the location of B was varied systematically. Measures of electrode discrimination and subjective perceptual difference were also included for comparison. There was strong intersubject variation in the pattern of results. One of the participants participated in a second series of experiments, the results of which indicated that he was able to perceptually segregate stimuli that were different in cochlear electrode location, as well as stimuli that were different in temporal envelope. Although preliminary, these results suggest that it is possible for some cochlear implant listeners to perceptually segregate stimuli based on differences in cochlear location as well as temporal envelope.},

@article{Alain2008,
abstract = {Purpose of review: From the cochlea to associative auditory cortex, incoming acoustic data undergo a series of transformations that allow us to build up representations of the various sound sources present in the environment. Here, we examine the role of selective attention in this process, with an emphasis on studies understanding how the human brain solves complex auditory scenes. We also examine the potential usefulness of the scene analysis framework in research and clinical application to hearing problems. Recent findings: Evidence from behavioral and neuroimaging studies suggests that auditory scene analysis engages attention-independent as well as attention-dependent processes. Selective attention may enhance figure-ground segregation via a sensory gain control mechanism that enhances the processing of task-relevant acoustic data, and a suppression mechanism that attenuates neuronal responses to task-irrelevant stimuli. Moreover, selective attention keeps sound representations active in memory, thereby easing their integration and comparison with stored (schemata) representations of prior sound objects. Summary: Understanding an auditory scene requires complex interactions between data-driven and higher level schema-driven processes that reflect listeners' knowledge and experiences with the auditory environment. Such interactions are at the forefront of hearing and determine our perceptual experience. (C) 2008 Lippincott Williams {\&} Wilkins, Inc.},

First, connectional work reveals patterns of thalamocortical and corticocortical input unique to the auditory cortex. Second, physiological studies find multiple, interleaved auditory processing modules related to corticocortical connections and embedded in the isofrequency gradient. Third, functional analyses demonstrate independent processing streams for sound localization and identification analogous to the 'what' and 'where' streams in visual cortex, although the modular arrangements are modality-specific.

Whereas synaptic plasticity, an important cellular mechanism, has been studied in great detail, we know much less about how learning is implemented at the level of neuronal circuits and, in particular, how interactions between distinct types of neurons within local networks contribute to the process of learning. Here we show that acquisition of associative fear memories depends on the recruitment of a disinhibitory microcircuit in the mouse auditory cortex. Fear-conditioning-associated disinhibition in auditory cortex is driven by foot-shock-mediated cholinergic activation of layer 1 interneurons, in turn generating inhibition of layer 2/3 parvalbumin-positive interneurons. Importantly, pharmacological or optogenetic block of pyramidal neuron disinhibition abolishes fear learning. Together, these data demonstrate that stimulus convergence in the auditory cortex is necessary for associative fear learning to complex tones, define the circuit elements mediating this convergence and suggest that layer-1-mediated disinhibition is an important mechanism underlying learning and information processing in neocortical circuits.},

abstract = {1. Adult owl monkeys were trained to detect differences in the frequency of a tactile flutter-vibration stimulus above a 20-Hz standard. All stimuli were delivered to a constant skin site restricted to a small part of a segment of one finger. The frequency-difference discrimination performance of all but one of these monkeys improved progressively with training. 2. The distributed responses of cortical neurons ("maps") of the hand surfaces were defined in detail in somatosensory cortical area 3b. Representations of trained hands were compared with those of the opposite, untrained hand, and to the area 3b representations of hands in a second set of monkeys that were stimulated tactually in the same manner while these monkeys were attending to auditory stimuli (passive stimulation controls). 3. The cortical representations of the trained hands were substantially more complex in topographic detail than the representations of unstimulated hands or of passively stimulated control hands. 4. In all well-trained monkeys the representations of the restricted skin location trained in the behavioral task were significantly (1.5 to greater than 3 times) greater in area than were the representations of equivalent skin locations on control digits. However, the overall extents of the representations of behaviorally stimulated fingers were not larger than those of control fingers in the same hemisphere, or in opposite hemisphere controls. 5. The receptive fields representing the trained skin were significantly larger than receptive fields representing control digits in all but one trained monkey. The largest receptive fields were centered in the zone of representation of the behaviorally engaged skin, but they were not limited to it. Large receptive fields were recorded in a 1- to 2-mm-wide zone in the area 3b maps of trained hands. 6. Receptive-field sizes were also statistically significantly larger on at least one adjacent, untrained digit when compared with the receptive fields recorded on the homologous digit of the opposite hand. 7. There was an increase in the percent overlaps of receptive fields in the cortical zone of representation of the trained skin. A significant number of receptive fields were centered on the behaviorally trained skin site. 8. The effects of increased topographic complexity, increased representation of the trained skin location, increased receptive-field size, and increased receptive-field overlap were not observed in the representations of the untrained hands in these same monkeys. Only modest increases in topographic complexity were recorded in the representations of passively stimulated hands, and no effects on receptive-field size or overlap were noted.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {Synchronized oscillations and inhibitory interneurons have important and interconnected roles within cortical microcircuits. In particular, interneurons defined by the fast-spiking phenotype and expression of the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin have been suggested to be involved in gamma (30-80 Hz) oscillations, which are hypothesized to enhance information processing. However, because parvalbumin interneurons cannot be selectively controlled, definitive tests of their functional significance in gamma oscillations, and quantitative assessment of the impact of parvalbumin interneurons and gamma oscillations on cortical circuits, have been lacking despite potentially enormous significance (for example, abnormalities in parvalbumin interneurons may underlie altered gamma-frequency synchronization and cognition in schizophrenia and autism). Here we use a panel of optogenetic technologies in mice to selectively modulate multiple distinct circuit elements in neocortex, alone or in combination. We find that inhibiting parvalbumin interneurons suppresses gamma oscillations in vivo, whereas driving these interneurons (even by means of non-rhythmic principal cell activity) is sufficient to generate emergent gamma-frequency rhythmicity. Moreover, gamma-frequency modulation of excitatory input in turn was found to enhance signal transmission in neocortex by reducing circuit noise and amplifying circuit signals, including inputs to parvalbumin interneurons. As demonstrated here, optogenetics opens the door to a new kind of informational analysis of brain function, permitting quantitative delineation of the functional significance of individual elements in the emergent operation and function of intact neural circuitry.},

abstract = {Visual stimuli contain a limited amount of information that could potentially be used to perform a given visual task. At successive stages of visual processing, some of this information is lost and some is transmitted to higher stages. This article describes a new analysis, based on the concept of the ideal observer in signal detection theory, that allows one to trace the flow of discrimination information through the initial physiological stages of visual processing, for arbitrary spatio-chromatic stimuli. This ideal-observer analysis provides a rigorous means of measuring the information content of visual stimuli and of assessing the contribution of specific physiological mechanisms to discrimination performance. Here, the analysis is developed for the physiological mechanisms up to the level of the photoreceptor. It is shown that many psychophysical phenomena previously attributed to neural mechanisms may be explained by variations in the information content of the stimuli and by preneural mechanisms.},

Although choice probabilities have been measured extensively, their interpretation has remained fraught with difficulty. We derive the mathematical relationship between choice probabilities, read-out weights and correlated variability in the standard neural decision-making model. Our solution allowed us to prove and generalize earlier observations on the basis of numerical simulations and to derive new predictions. Notably, our results indicate how the read-out weight profile, or decoding strategy, can be inferred from experimentally measurable quantities. Furthermore, we developed a test to decide whether the decoding weights of individual neurons are optimal for the task, even without knowing the underlying correlations. We confirmed the practicality of our approach using simulated data from a realistic population model. Thus, our findings provide a theoretical foundation for a growing body of experimental results on choice probabilities and correlations.},

The detection of these cues depends on the convergence of the inputs to each ear, a process that first occurs in the brainstem. The conscious perception of these cues is likely to involve higher centers. Using novel stimuli that produce different perceptions of movement in the presence of identical phase and amplitude modulation components, we have demonstrated human brain areas that are active specifically during the perception of sound movement. Both functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) demonstrated the involvement of the right parietal cortex in sound movement perception with these stimuli.},

The psychophysical properties of binocular rivalry have been well described, but newer imaging and electrophysiological techniques have not resolved the issue of where in the brain rivalry occurs. The most recent evidence supports a view of rivalry as a series of processes, each of which is implemented by neural mechanisms at different levels of the visual hierarchy. Although unanswered questions remain, this view of rivalry might allow us to resolve some of the controversies and apparent contradictions that have emerged from its study.},

abstract = {Synaptic ribbons, found at the presynaptic membrane of sensory cells in both ear and eye, have been implicated in the vesicle-pool dynamics of synaptic transmission. To elucidate ribbon function, we characterized the response properties of single auditory nerve fibers in mice lacking Bassoon, a scaffolding protein involved in anchoring ribbons to the membrane. In bassoon mutants, immunohistochemistry showed that fewer than 3{\%} of the hair cells' afferent synapses retained anchored ribbons. Auditory nerve fibers from mutants had normal threshold, dynamic range, and postonset adaptation in response to tone bursts, and they were able to phase lock with normal precision to amplitude-modulated tones. However, spontaneous and sound-evoked discharge rates were reduced, and the reliability of spikes, particularly at stimulus onset, was significantly degraded as shown by an increased variance of first-spike latencies. Modeling based on in vitro studies of normal and mutant hair cells links these findings to reduced release rates at the synapse. The degradation of response reliability in these mutants suggests that the ribbon and/or Bassoon normally facilitate high rates of exocytosis and that its absence significantly compromises the temporal resolving power of the auditory system.},

Here we provide evidence that the auditory system summarizes the temporal details of sounds using time-averaged statistics. We measured discrimination of 'sound textures' that were characterized by particular statistical properties, as normally result from the superposition of many acoustic features in auditory scenes. When listeners discriminated examples of different textures, performance improved with excerpt duration. In contrast, when listeners discriminated different examples of the same texture, performance declined with duration, a paradoxical result given that the information available for discrimination grows with duration. These results indicate that once these sounds are of moderate length, the brain's representation is limited to time-averaged statistics, which, for different examples of the same texture, converge to the same values with increasing duration. Such statistical representations produce good categorical discrimination, but limit the ability to discern temporal detail.},

abstract = {Neurons in the auditory brain stem encode signals with exceptional temporal precision. A low-threshold potassium current, IKLT, present in many auditory brain stem structures and thought to enhance temporal encoding, facilitates spike selection of rapid input current transients through an associated dynamic gate. Whether the dynamic nature of IKLT interacts with the timescales in spectrally rich input to influence spike encoding remains unclear. We examine the general influence of IKLT on spike encoding of stochastic stimuli using a pattern classification analysis between spike responses from a ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN) model containing IKLT, and the same model with the IKLT dynamics removed. The influence of IKLT on spike encoding depended on the spectral content of the current stimulus such that maximal IKLT influence occurred for stimuli with power concentrated at frequencies low enough ({\textless}500 Hz) to allow IKLT activation. Further, broadband stimuli significantly decreased the influence of IKLT on spike encoding, suggesting that broadband stimuli are not well suited for investigating the influence of some dynamic membrane nonlinearities. Finally, pattern classification on spike responses was performed for physiologically realistic conductance stimuli created from various sounds filtered through an auditory nerve (AN) model. Regardless of the sound, the synaptic input arriving at VCN had similar low-pass power spectra, which led to a large influence of IKLT on spike encoding, suggesting that the subthreshold dynamics of IKLT plays a significant role in shaping the response of real auditory brain stem neurons.},

Independently, human studies have shown that training mostly improves discrimination thresholds. We found that aversive learning actually induced an increase in discrimination thresholds in humans and that subjective aversion during conditioning predicted the individual threshold change. This counterintuitive performance deterioration occurred when using odors or sounds as aversive reinforcers and was not a result of attentional distraction or decision bias. In contrast, positive reinforcement or mere exposure induced the typically reported decrease in thresholds. Our findings indicate that aversive outcomes induce wider stimulus generalization by modulating perceptual thresholds, suggesting the engagement of low-level mechanisms. We suggest that for risk- or loss-related stimuli, less specificity could be a benefit, as it invokes the same mechanisms that respond quickly and efficiently in the face of danger.},

Since its discovery, channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) has been used as a research tool to depolarize membranes of excitable cells with light. Subsequent chimeragenesis, mutagenesis and bioinformatic approaches have introduced additional ChR variants, such as channelrhodopsin-2 with H134R mutation (ChR2/H134R), channelrhodopsin-2 with E123T mutation (ChETA), Volvox carteri channelrhodopsin-1 (VChR1), Volvox carteri channelrhodopsin-2 (VChR2), channelrhodopsin-2 with C128 or D156A mutations (ChR2/C128X/D156A), chimera D (ChD), chimera EF (ChEF) and chimera EF with I170V mutation (I170V). Each of these ChR variuants has unique features and limitations, but there are few resources summarizing and comparing these ChRs in a systematic manner. In this review, the seven following key properties of ChRs that have significant influences on their effectiveness as research tools are examined: conductance, selectivity, kinetics, desensitization, light sensitivity, spectral response and membrane trafficking. Using this information, valuable qualities and deficits of each ChR variant are summarized. Optimal uses and potential future improvements of ChRs as optogenetic tools are also discussed.},

abstract = {The trichromatic primate retina parses the colour content of a visual scene into 'red/green' and 'blue/yellow' representations. Cortical circuits must combine the information encoded in these colour-opponent signals to reconstruct the full range of perceived colours. Red/green and blue/yellow inputs are relayed by the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of thalamus to primary visual cortex (V1), so understanding how cortical circuits transform these signals requires understanding how LGN inputs to V1 are organized. Here we report direct recordings from LGN afferent axons in muscimol-inactivated V1. We found that blue/yellow afferents terminated exclusively in superficial cortical layers 3B and 4A, whereas red/green afferents were encountered only in deeper cortex, in lower layer 4C. We also describe a distinct cortical target for 'blue-OFF' cells, whose afferents terminated in layer 4A and seemed patchy in organization. The more common 'blue-ON' afferents were found in 4A as well as lower layer 2/3. Chromatic information is thus conveyed to V1 by parallel, anatomically segregated colour-opponent systems, to be combined at a later stage of the colour circuit.},

abstract = {Adults with sensory impairment, such as reduced hearing acuity, have impaired ability to recall identifiable words, even when their memory is otherwise normal. We hypothesize that poorer stimulus quality causes weaker activity in neurons responsive to the stimulus and more time to elapse between stimulus onset and identification. The weaker activity and increased delay to stimulus identification reduce the necessary strengthening of connections between neurons active before stimulus presentation and neurons active at the time of stimulus identification. We test our hypothesis through a biologically motivated computational model, which performs item recognition, memory formation and memory retrieval. In our simulations, spiking neurons are distributed into pools representing either items or context, in two separate, but connected winner-takes-all (WTA) networks. We include associative, Hebbian learning, by comparing multiple forms of spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), which strengthen synapses between coactive neurons during stimulus identification. Synaptic strengthening by STDP can be sufficient to reactivate neurons during recall if their activity during a prior stimulus rose strongly and rapidly. We find that a single poor quality stimulus impairs recall of neighboring stimuli as well as the weak stimulus itself. We demonstrate that within the WTA paradigm of word recognition, reactivation of separate, connected sets of non-word, context cells permits reverse recall. Also, only with such coactive context cells, does slowing the rate of stimulus presentation increase recall probability. We conclude that significant temporal overlap of neural activity patterns, absent from individual WTA networks, is necessary to match behavioral data for word recall.},

abstract = {Axonal projections from the dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus (DNLL) distribute contralaterally in a pattern of banded layers in the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus (IC). The banded pattern of DNLL projections is already in the IC by onset of hearing in postnatal rat pups. Previously, it was shown that unilateral cochlear ablation in neonatal rat pups disrupted the banded pattern in IC for the projections of the DNLL contralateral to the ablation but not those of the DNLL ipsilateral to the ablation. In the present study, bilateral cochlear ablation or sham surgery was performed at postnatal day 9 (P9) after which rat pups were killed at P12 and the brains removed to study axonal projections of the DNLL. A lipophilic carbocyanine dye, 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI), was placed in the dorsal tegmental commissure of Probst to label decussating DNLL axons that end in the central nucleus of the contralateral IC. The distribution of labeled fibers across the central nucleus of the IC was analyzed in digital images by comparing the pattern of labeling with a sine model of periodic distribution of banded layers. In the control group, labeled axons formed a regular pattern of dense banded layers in IC. In the bilateral cochlear ablation group, labeled axons in the IC were distributed diffusely and there was little or no regular pattern of dense bands of axonal labeling. The influence of the cochlea on developing auditory circuits possibly mediated by activity-dependent mechanisms is discussed.},

Subjects can become conscious of an isolated object or the gist of a scene despite the near absence of top-down attention; conversely, subjects can attend to perceptually invisible objects. Furthermore, top-down attention and consciousness can have opposing effects. Such dissociations are easier to understand when the different functions of these two processes are considered.

abstract = {The build-up of auditory stream segregation refers to the notion that sequences of alternating A and B sounds initially tend to be heard as a single stream, but with time appear to split into separate streams. The central assumption in the analysis of this phenomenon is that streaming sequences are perceived as one stream at the beginning by default. In the present study, we test the validity of this assumption and document its impact on the apparent build-up phenomenon. Human listeners were presented with ABAB sequences, where A and B were harmonic tone complexes of seven different fundamental frequency separations ($\Delta$f) ranging from 2 to 14 semitones. Subjects had to indicate, as promptly as possible, their initial percept of the sequences, as either "one stream" or "two streams," and any changes thereof during the sequences. We found that subjects did not generally indicate a one-stream percept at the beginning of streaming sequences. Instead, the first perceptual decision depended on $\Delta$f, with the probability of a one-stream percept decreasing, and that of a two-stream percept increasing, with increasing $\Delta$f. Furthermore, subjects required some time to make and report a decision on their perceptual organization. Taking this time into account, the resulting time courses of two-stream probabilities differ markedly from those suggested by the conventional analysis. A build-up-like increase in two-stream probability was found only for the $\Delta$f of six semitones. At the other $\Delta$f conditions no or only minor increases in two-stream probability occurred. These results shed new light on the build-up of stream segregation and its possible neural correlates.},

abstract = {In this review we re-examine the concept of a cortical column in macaque primary visual cortex, and consider to what extent a functionally defined column reflects any sort of anatomical entity that subdivides cortical territory. Functional studies have shown that columns relating to different response properties are mapped in cortex at different spatial scales. We suggest that these properties first emerge in mid-layer 4C through a combination of thalamic afferent inputs and local intracortical circuitry, and are then transferred to other layers in a columnar fashion, via interlaminar relays, where additional processing occurs. However, several properties are not strictly columnar since they do not appear in all cortical layers. In contrast to the functional column, an anatomically based cortical column is defined most clearly in terms of the reciprocal connections it makes, both via intra-areal lateral connections and inter-areal feedback/feedforward pathways. The column boundaries are reinforced by interplay between lateral inhibition spreading beyond the column boundary and disinhibition within the column. The anatomical column acts as a functionally tuned unit and point of information collation from laterally offset regions and feedback pathways. Thalamic inputs provide the high-contrast receptive field sizes of the column's neurons, intra-areal lateral connections provide their low contrast summation field sizes, and feedback pathways provide surround modulation of receptive fields responses.},

We see the problem in stark form if we ask how we can tell whether representations inside a Fodorian module are phenomenally conscious. The methodology would seem straightforward: Find the neural natural kinds that are the basis of phenomenal consciousness in clear cases--when subjects are completely confident and we have no reason to doubt their authority--and look to see whether those neural natural kinds exist within Fodorian modules. But a puzzle arises: Do we include the machinery underlying reportability within the neural natural kinds of the clear cases? If the answer is "Yes," then there can be no phenomenally conscious representations in Fodorian modules. But how can we know if the answer is "Yes"? The suggested methodology requires an answer to the question it was supposed to answer! This target article argues for an abstract solution to the problem and exhibits a source of empirical data that is relevant, data that show that in a certain sense phenomenal consciousness overflows cognitive accessibility. I argue that we can find a neural realizer of this overflow if we assume that the neural basis of phenomenal consciousness does not include the neural basis of cognitive accessibility and that this assumption is justified (other things being equal) by the explanations it allows.},

abstract = {Photoreceptors strongly attenuate high temporal frequencies. Hence when an image moves, high spatial frequency components are lost if their direction of modulation coincides with the direction of movement, but not if it is orthogonal. The power spectra of natural images are remarkably consistent in having a 1/f 2 falloff in power in all directions. For moving images, the spatial power spectra will be distorted by becoming steeper in the direction corresponding to modulation in the direction of motion, and the contours of equal power will tend to become elliptical. This study demonstrates that the mammalian visual system is specifically sensitive to such anisotropic changes of the local power spectrum, and it is suggested that these distortions are used to determine patterns of optic flow. Convergent evidence from work on Glass figures, motion streaks, and sensitivity to non-Cartesian gratings is called on in support of this interpretation, which has been foreshadowed in several recent publications.},

abstract = {Responses of low characteristic-frequency (CF) neurons in the inferior colliculus were obtained to amplitude-modulated (AM) high-frequency tones in which the modulation rate was equal to the neuron's CF. Despite all spectral components lying outside the pure tone-evoked response areas, discharge rates were modulated by the AM signals. Introducing a low-frequency tone (CF - 1 Hz) to the same ear as the AM tones produced a 1-Hz beat in the neural response. Introducing a tone (CF - 1 Hz) to the opposite ear to the AM tone also produced a beat in the neural response, with the beat at the period of the interaural phase difference between the CF - 1 Hz tone in one ear, and the AM rate in the other ear. The monaural and interaural interactions of the AM signals with introduced pure tones suggest that AM tones generate combination tones, (inter-modulation distortion) on the basilar membrane. These interact with low-frequency tones presented to the same ear to produce monaural beats on the basilar membrane, modulating the responses of inferior colliculus (IC) neurons on the 1-Hz period of the monaural beats or interacting binaurally with neural input generated in response to stimulation of the opposite ear. The auditory midbrain appears to show a robust representation of cochlear distortions generated by amplitude-modulated sounds.},

abstract = {This paper describes the temporal responses of anteroventral cochlear nucleus (AVCN) units in the chinchilla to rippled noises. Rippled noise is generated when a wideband noise is delayed and added (cos+ noise) or subtracted (cos- noise) to the undelayed noise. Renewal densities were constructed to evaluate synchronous discharges at the delay. In response to rippled noise, AVCN units which show phase locking to best frequency (BF) tones gave renewal densities having major peaks at the delay for cos+ noise, but nulls at the delay for cos- noise. Most AVCN units which did not show BF phase locking gave renewal densities that did not contain features related to the rippled noise delay; a few of these nonphase-locked units did show peaks in renewal densities for both cos+ and cos- noises. Synchrony at the rippled noise delay was also demonstrated with evoked potential recording. Autocorrelation functions of the neurophonic potential showed peaks at the rippled noise delay for both cos+ and cos- noises. In addition, peaks could be observed in the autocorrelation functions of neurophonic potentials for rippled noises with delays as short as 1 ms; peaks were never observed in renewal densities of single units for ripple delays as short as 1 ms. The results show that a temporal representation of rippled noise delay does exist in the AVCN and are consistent with current hypotheses regarding functions of AVCN subsystems. The temporal representation of the delay is a presumptive neural code for the pitches of rippled noises.},

abstract = {Among the crowning achievements of Hubel and Wiesel's highly influential studies on primary visual cortex is the description of the cortical hypercolumn, a set of cortical columns with functional properties spanning a particular parameter space. This fundamental concept laid the groundwork for the notion of a modular sensory cortex, canonical cortical circuits and an understanding of visual field coverage beyond simple retinotopy. Surprisingly, the search for and description of analogous hypercolumnar organizations in other cortical areas to date has been limited. In the present work, we have applied the hypercolumn concept to the functional organization of the second visual area, V2. We found it important to separate out the original definition of the hypercolumn from other associated observations and concepts, not all of which are applicable to V2. We present results indicating that, as in V1, the V2 hypercolumns for orientation and binocular interaction (disparity) run roughly orthogonal to each other. We quantified the 'nearest neighbour' periodicities for the hypercolumns for ocular dominance, orientation, colour and disparity, and found a marked similarity in the periodicities of all of these hypercolumns, both across hypercolumn type and across visual areas V1 and V2. The results support an underlying common mechanism that constrains the anatomical extent of hypercolumn systems, and highlight the original definition of the cortical hypercolumn.},

Many of the important forms of structure require higher-order (i.e. more than linear, pairwise) statistics to characterize, which makes models based on linear Hebbian learning, or principal components analysis, inappropriate for finding efficient codes for natural images. We suggest that a good objective for an efficient coding of natural scenes is to maximize the sparseness of the representation, and we show that a network that learns sparse codes of natural scenes succeeds in developing localized, oriented, bandpass receptive fields similar to those in the mammalian striate cortex.},

Here, we compared the magnitude and latency of attentional enhancement of firing rates in V1, V2, and V4 in the same animals performing the same task. We found a reverse order of attentional effects, such that attentional enhancement was larger and earlier in V4 and smaller and later in V1, with intermediate results in V2.

Frequently used models of V1 neurons, like the dynamic Linear filter--static nonlinearity--Poisson [corrected] spike encoder model, predict that receptive fields measured with different stimulus ensembles should be similar. Here, we tested this concept by comparing spatiotemporal maps of V1 neurons derived from two very different, but commonly used, stimulus ensembles: sparse noise and Hartley subspace stimuli. We found maps from the two methods agreed for neurons in input layer 4C but were very different for neurons in superficial layers of V1. Many layer 2/3 cells have receptive fields with multiple elongated subregions when mapped with Hartley stimuli, but their spatial maps collapse to only a single, less-elongated subregion when mapped with sparse noise. Moreover, for upper layer V1 neurons, the preferred orientation for Hartley maps is much closer to the preferred orientation measured with drifting gratings than is the orientation preference of sparse-noise maps. These results challenge the concept of a stimulus-invariant receptive field and imply that intracortical interactions shape fundamental properties of layer 2/3 neurons.},

Our model accounts for the experimentally and psychophysically observed phenomena: (1) it reproduces the distribution of dominance durations seen in both humans and primates, (2) it exhibits a lack of correlation between lengths of successive dominance durations, (3) variation of stimulus strength to one eye influences only the mean dominance duration of the contralateral eye, not the mean dominance duration of the ipsilateral eye, (4) increasing both stimuli strengths in parallel decreases the mean dominance durations. We have also derived a reduced population rate model from our spiking model from which explicit expressions for the dependence of the dominance durations on input strengths are analytically calculated. We also use this reduced model to derive an expression for the distribution of dominance durations seen within an individual.},

abstract = {Cortical-form vision comprises multiple, hierarchically arranged areas with feedforward and feedback interconnections. This complex architecture poses difficulties for attempts to link perceptual phenomena to activity at a particular level of the system. This difficulty has been especially salient in studies of binocular rivalry alternations, where there is seemingly conflicting evidence for a locus in primary visual cortex or alternatively in higher cortical areas devoted to object perception. Here, I use a competitive neural model to demonstrate that the data require at least two hierarchic rivalry stages for their explanation. This model demonstrates that competitive inhibition in the first rivalry stage can be eliminated by using suitable stimulus dynamics, thereby revealing properties of a later stage, a result obtained with both spike-rate and conductance-based model neurons. This result provides a synthesis of competing rivalry theories and suggests that neural competition may be a general characteristic throughout the form-vision hierarchy.},

Cerebral Cortex, 9, 406-413, 1999]. Neural correlates of texture boundary detection have been found in monkey V1 [Sillito, A. M., Grieve, K. L., Jones, H. E., Cudeiro, J., {\&} Davis, J.

Journal of Neuroscience, 21, 1698-1709, 2001; Lamme, V. A. F. The neurophysiology of figure ground segregation in primary visual-cortex. Journal of Neuroscience, 15, 1605-1615, 1995], and whether boundary detection or surface segregation signals can also be measured in human V1, is more controversial [Kastner, S., De Weerd, P., {\&} Ungerleider, L. G. Texture segregation in the human visual cortex: A functional MRI study. Journal of Neurophysiology, 83, 2453-2457, 2000]. Here we present electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging data that have been recorded with a paradigm that makes it possible to differentiate between boundary detection and scene segmentation in humans. In this way, we were able to show with EEG that neural correlates of texture boundary detection are first present in the early visual cortex around 92 msec and then spread toward the parietal and temporal lobes. Correlates of surface segregation first appear in temporal areas (around 112 msec) and from there appear to spread to parietal, and back to occipital areas. After 208 msec, correlates of surface segregation and boundary detection also appear in more frontal areas. Blood oxygenation level-dependent magnetic resonance imaging results show correlates of boundary detection and surface segregation in all early visual areas including V1. We conclude that texture boundaries are detected in a feedforward fashion and are represented at increasing latencies in higher visual areas. Surface segregation, on the other hand, is represented in "reverse hierarchical" fashion and seems to arise from feedback signals toward early visual areas such as V1.},

abstract = {Selective attention filters information to limit what is encoded and maintained in working memory. Although the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is central to both selective attention and working memory, the underlying neural processes that link these cognitive abilities remain elusive. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging to guide repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation with electroencephalographic recordings in humans, we perturbed PFC function at the inferior frontal junction in participants before they performed a selective-attention, delayed-recognition task. This resulted in diminished top-down modulation of activity in posterior cortex during early encoding stages, which predicted a subsequent decrement in working memory accuracy. Participants with stronger fronto-posterior functional connectivity displayed greater disruptive effects. Our data further suggests that broad alpha-band (7-14 Hz) phase coherence subserved this long-distance top-down modulation. These results suggest that top-down modulation mediated by the prefrontal cortex is a causal link between early attentional processes and subsequent memory performance.},

Statistics textbooks and the simulation literature provide several alternatives to Pearson's correlation. However, the relative performance of these alternatives has been unclear. Two simulation studies were conducted to compare 12 methods, including Pearson, Spearman's rank-order, transformation, and resampling approaches. With most sample sizes (n ??? 20), Type I and Type II error rates were minimized by transforming the data to a normal shape prior to assessing the Pearson correlation. Among transformation approaches, a general purpose rank-based inverse normal transformation (i.e., transformation to rankit scores) was most beneficial. However, when samples were both small (n ??? 10) and extremely nonnormal, the permutation test often outperformed other alternatives, including various bootstrap tests.},

abstract = {Traditionally, research on vision focused on its role in perception and our cognitive life. Except for the study of eye movements, which have been regarded as an information-seeking adjunct to visual perception, little attention was paid to the way in which vision is used to control our actions, particularly the movements of our hands and limbs. Over the last 25 years all of that has changed. Researchers are now actively investigating the way in which vision is used to control a broad range of complex goal-directed action - and are exploring the neural substrates of that control. A new model of the functional organization of the visual pathways in the primate cerebral cortex has emerged, one that posits a division of labor between vision-for-action (the dorsal stream) and vision-for-perception (the ventral stream). In this review, I examine some of the seminal work on the role of vision in the control of manual prehension and on the visual cues that play a critical role in this important human skill. I then review the key evidence for the perception-action model, particularly with reference to the role of the dorsal stream in the control of manual prehension, touching on recent work that both reinforces and challenges this account of the organization of the visual system.},

abstract = {This study examined the output of the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus to the medial geniculate body and other parts of the nervous system in the mustached bat (Pteronotus parnellii). Small deposits of anterograde tracers (horseradish peroxidase, [3H]leucine, Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin, wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, or biocytin) were made at physiologically defined sites in the central nucleus representing major components of the bat's echolocation signal. The topography, frequency specificity, and axonal morphology of these outputs were studied. The medial geniculate body was a major target of inferior collicular neurons, with three distinct input patterns. The projection to the ventral division was tonotopically organized, but had a relatively sparse contribution from neurons representing frequency modulated components of the biosonar pulse. The second input was to the rostral medial geniculate body, in which projections from inferior collicular neurons representing constant frequency sonar components were separated from those representing frequency modulated components. A third input was to the suprageniculate nucleus, which received strong, topographically arranged projections. Inputs to the dorsal nucleus and medial division were also observed. Extrathalamic regions receiving input included the pontine gray, external nucleus of the inferior colliculus, pericollicular tegmentum, nucleus of the brachium of the inferior colliculus, and pretectum. These central nucleus projections differed in organization and the structure of axon terminals, suggesting different physiological influences on their target nuclei. These results demonstrate that the central nucleus has divergent projections to various sensory and premotor nuclei, besides its well-established projection to the medial geniculate body.},

We compared the distributions of orientation and spatial frequency selectivity, as well as the correlation between the two, in the model with what we observed in the 4C$\alpha$ population. We found that (1) in the model, both spatial frequency and orientation selectivity of neuronal firing are greater and more diverse than the LGN inputs to model neurons; (2) orientation and spatial frequency selectivity co-vary in the model in a way very similar to what we observed in layer 4C$\alpha$ neurons; (3) in the model, orientation and spatial frequency selectivity co-vary because of intra-cortical inhibition. The results suggest that cortical inhibition provides a common mechanism for selectivity in multiple dimensions.},

abstract = {In three experiments, we addressed the issue of attention effects on unattended sound processing when one auditory stream is selected from three potential streams, creating a simple model of the cocktail party situation. We recorded event-related brain potentials (ERPs) to determine the way in which unattended, task-irrelevant sounds were stored in auditory memory (i.e., as one integrated stream or as two distinct streams). Subjects were instructed to ignore all the sounds and attend to a visual task or to selectively attend to a subset of the sounds and perform a task with the sounds (Experiments 1 and 2). A third (behavioral) experiment was conducted to test whether global pattern violations (used in Experiments 1 and 2) were perceptible when the sounds were segregated. We found that the mismatch negativity ERP component, an index of auditory change detection, was evoked by infrequent pattern violations occurring in the unattended sounds when all the sounds were ignored, but not when attention was focused on a subset of the sounds. The results demonstrate that multiple unattended sound streams can segregate by frequency range but that selectively attending to a subset of the sounds can modify the extent to which the unattended sounds are processed. These results are consistent with models in animal and human studies showing that attentional control can limit the processing of unattended input in favor of attended sensory inputs, thereby facilitating the ability to achieve behavioral goals.},

Noise was routed to either the same (the "overlapped" condition) or a different set of electrodes (the "interlaced" condition), where speech and noise electrodes were separated by one- and two-electrode spacings for ten- and six-electrode presentations, respectively. Results indicated a small but significant improvement in consonant recognition (5{\%}-10{\%}) in the interlaced condition with a two-electrode spacing (approximately 1.1 mm) in two subjects. It appears that the results were influenced by peripheral channel interactions, partially accounting for individual variability. Although the overall effect was small and observed from a small number of subjects, the present study demonstrated that CI users' performance on segregating the target from the background might be improved if these sounds were presented with sufficient peripheral separation.},

Shape information at the retinal level is hopelessly complex, variable and implicit. The ventral pathway must somehow transform retinal signals into much more compact, stable and explicit representations of object shape. Recent findings highlight key aspects of this transformation: higher-order contour derivatives, structural representation in object-based coordinates, composite shape tuning dimensions, and long-term storage of object knowledge. These coding principles could help to explain our remarkable ability to perceive, distinguish, remember and understand a virtual infinity of objects.},

abstract = {Attention powerfully influences auditory perception, but little is understood about the mechanisms whereby attention sharpens responses to unattended sounds. We used high-resolution surface mapping techniques (using functional magnetic resonance imaging, fMRI) to examine activity in human auditory cortex during an intermodal selective attention task. Stimulus-dependent activations (SDAs), evoked by unattended sounds during demanding visual tasks, were maximal over mesial auditory cortex. They were tuned to sound frequency and location, and showed rapid adaptation to repeated sounds. Attention-related modulations (ARMs) were isolated as response enhancements that occurred when subjects performed pitch-discrimination tasks. In contrast to SDAs, ARMs were localized to lateral auditory cortex, showed broad frequency and location tuning, and increased in amplitude with sound repetition. The results suggest a functional dichotomy of auditory cortical fields: stimulus-determined mesial fields that faithfully transmit acoustic information, and attentionally labile lateral fields that analyze acoustic features of behaviorally relevant sounds.},

abstract = {Several fMRI studies have reported MT+ response increases correlated with perception of the motion aftereffect (MAE). However, attention can strongly affect MT+ responses, and subjects may naturally attend more to the MAE than control trials without MAE. We found that requiring subjects to attend to motion on both MAE and control trials produced equal levels of MT+ response, suggesting that attention may have confounded the interpretation of previous experiments; in our data, attention accounts for the entire effect. After eliminating this confound, we observed that direction-selective motion adaptation produced a direction-selective imbalance in MT+ responses (and earlier visual areas), and yielded a corresponding asymmetry in speed discrimination thresholds. These findings provide physiological evidence that population level response imbalances underlie the MAE, and quantify the relative proportions of direction-selective neurons across human visual areas.},

abstract = {Binocular rivalry is a phenomenon that occurs when a different image is presented to each eye. The observer generally perceives just one image at a time, with perceptual switches occurring every few seconds. A natural assumption is that this perceptual mutual exclusivity is achieved via mutual inhibition between populations of neurons that encode for either percept. Theoretical models that incorporate mutual inhibition have been largely successful at capturing experimental features of rivalry, including Levelt's propositions, which characterize perceptual dominance durations as a function of image contrasts. However, basic mutual inhibition models do not fully comply with Levelt's fourth proposition, which states that percepts alternate faster as the stimulus contrasts to both eyes are increased simultaneously. This theory-experiment discrepancy has been taken as evidence against the role of mutual inhibition for binocular rivalry. Here, we show how various biophysically plausible modifications to mutual inhibition models can resolve this problem.},

abstract = {The effects of experimental lesions of the monkey prefrontal cortex have played a predominant role in current conceptualizations of the functional organization of the lateral prefrontal cortex, especially with regard to working memory. The loss or sparing of certain performance abilities has been shown to be attributable to differences in the specific requirements of behavioral testing (e.g., spatial vs. non-spatial memoranda) along with differences in the specific locations of applied ablations (e.g., dorsal vs. ventral prefrontal cortex). Such findings, which have accumulated now for over a century, have led to widespread acceptance that the dorsolateral and ventrolateral aspects of the prefrontal cortex may perform different, specialized roles in higher order cognition. Nonetheless, it remains unclear and controversial how the lateral prefrontal cortex is functionally organized. Two main views propose different types of functional specialization of the dorsal and ventral prefrontal cortex. The first contends that the lateral prefrontal cortex is segregated according to the processing of spatial and nonspatial domains of information. The second contends that domain specialization is not the key to the organization of the prefrontal cortex, but that instead, the dorsal and ventral prefrontal cortices perform qualitatively different operations. This report critically reviews all relevant monkey lesion studies that have served as the foundation for current theories regarding the functional organization of the prefrontal cortex. Our goals are to evaluate how well the existing lesion data support each theory and to enumerate caveats that must be considered when interpreting the relevant literature.},

abstract = {Cortical neurons of behaving animals generate irregular spike sequences. Recently, there has been a heated discussion about the origin of this irregularity. Softky and Koch (1993) pointed out the inability of standard single-neuron models to reproduce the irregularity of the observed spike sequences when the model parameters are chosen within a certain range that they consider to be plausible. Shadlen and Newsome (1994), on the other hand, demonstrated that a standard leaky integrate-and-fire model can reproduce the irregularity if the inhibition is balanced with the excitation. Motivated by this discussion, we attempted to determine whether the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, which is naturally derived from the leaky integration assumption, can in fact reproduce higher-order statistics of biological data. For this purpose, we consider actual neuronal spike sequences recorded from the monkey prefrontal cortex to calculate the higher-order statistics of the interspike intervals. Consistency of the data with the model is examined on the basis of the coefficient of variation and the skewness coefficient, which are, respectively, a measure of the spiking irregularity and a measure of the asymmetry of the interval distribution. It is found that the biological data are not consistent with the model if the model time constant assumes a value within a certain range believed to cover all reasonable values. This fact suggests that the leaky integrate-and-fire model with the assumption of uncorrelated inputs is not adequate to account for the spiking in at least some cortical neurons.},

Neural priming in early sensory regions was unaffected by left-frontal TMS--a finding that provides evidence for separable conceptual and perceptual components of priming.},

Responses of neurons from the inferior temporal cortex (IT) are selective to different objects, yet tolerant ("invariant") to changes in object position, scale, and pose. How does the brain construct this neuronal tolerance? We report a form of neuronal learning that suggests the underlying solution. Targeted alteration of the natural temporal contiguity of visual experience caused specific changes in IT position tolerance. This unsupervised temporal slowness learning (UTL) was substantial, increased with experience, and was significant in single IT neurons after just 1 hour. Together with previous theoretical work and human object perception experiments, we speculate that UTL may reflect the mechanism by which the visual stream builds and maintains tolerant object representations.},

In particular, attractor network models have been proposed in which there is a coexistence between a non-selective attractor state with low background activity with selective attractor states in which sub-groups of neurons fire at rates which are higher (but not much higher) than background rates. A recent detailed statistical analysis of the data seems however to challenge such attractor models: the data indicates that firing during persistent activity is highly irregular (with an average CV larger than 1), while models predict a more regular firing process (CV smaller than 1). We discuss here recent proposals that allow to reproduce this feature of the experiments.},

abstract = {Is binaural processing in humans different to that of other mammals? While psychophysical data suggest that the range of internal delays necessary for processing interaural time differences is at least +/-3 ms, physiological data from small mammals indicate a more limited range. This study demonstrates that binaural detection is impeded by reduced interaural coherence in auditory channels remote from the signal frequency, in accordance with the wider critical bandwidths reported for binaural processing. This explains previous psychophysical data without requiring long internal delays. The current psychophysical data support the view that human binaural processing is similar to that of other mammals.},

A number of computational models for binocular rivalry have been proposed; most can be categorised as either "rate" models, containing a small number of variables, or as more biophysically-realistic "spiking neuron" models. However, a principled derivation of a reduced model from a spiking model is lacking. We present two such derivations, one heuristic and a second using recently-developed data-mining techniques to extract a small number of "macroscopic" variables from the results of a spiking neuron model simulation. We also consider bifurcations that can occur as parameters are varied, and the role of noise in such systems. Our methods are applicable to a number of other models of interest.},

abstract = {In the auditory midbrain (inferior colliculus) and cortex (superior temporal gyrus) of awake squirrel monkeys profiles of click-evoked field potentials were recorded. The recording tracks were reconstructed anatomically. From the field potentials the one-dimensional current source density (CSD) distributions were calculated. By comparing the CSD profiles with the anatomical features of the reconstructed recording paths, the components of the CSDs could be attributed to certain anatomical sites. Thus a physiological method for the functional identification of recording sites was obtained. It permits the identification of depth locations of specific laminae in cortex. In the inferior colliculus it permits distinction between central and peripheral regions and between three depth segments. The CSDs in the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus lend functional support to the anatomical division into three distinct parts and, in addition, provide the temporal aspects of the main groups of synaptic activities. The CSDs in the auditory cortex permit determination of five different groups of excitatory synaptic activations. The spatio-temporal distributions of these components are very similar to those obtained in other neocortical areas and thus corroborate the hypothesis that afferent activity is relayed very similarly in all sensory areas of neocortex.},

To do this, we must assign simultaneously occurring frequency components to the correct source, and organize sounds appropriately over time. The physical cues that we exploit to do so are well-established; more recent research has focussed on the underlying neural bases, where most progress has been made in the study of a form of sequential organization known as "auditory streaming". Listeners' sensitivity to streaming cues can be captured in the responses of neurons in the primary auditory cortex, and in EEG wave components with a short latency ({\textless} 200ms). However, streaming can be strongly affected by attention, suggesting that this early processing either receives input from non-auditory areas, or feeds into processes that do.},

Investigating the multistable appearance of kinetic depth and binocular rivalry displays, we introduce cumulative history as a novel statistical measure of adaptive state. We show that cumulative history-an integral of past perceptual states, weighted toward the most recent states-significantly and consistently correlates with future dominance durations: the larger the cumulative history measure, the shorter are future dominance times, revealing a robust effect of neural adaptation. The characteristic time scale of cumulative history, which may be computed by Monte Carlo methods, correlates with average dominance durations, as expected for a measure of neural adaptation. When the cumulative histories of two competing percepts are balanced, perceptual reversals take longer and their outcome becomes random, demonstrating that perceptual reversals are fluctuation-driven in the absence of adaptational bias. Our findings quantify the role of neural adaptation in multistable perception, which accounts for approximately 10{\%} of the variability of reversal timing.},

@article{Farley2010,
abstract = {The significance of the mismatch negativity (MMN), an event-related potential measured in humans which indexes novelty in the auditory environment, has motivated a search for a cellular correlate of this process. A leading candidate is stimulus-specific adaptation (SSA) in auditory cortex units, which shares several characteristics with the MMN. Whether auditory cortex responses encode sensory novelty, a defining property of the MMN, however, has not been resolved. To evaluate this key issue, we used several variations of the auditory oddball paradigm from the human literature and examined psychophysical and pharmacological properties of multiunit activity in the auditory cortex of awake rodents. We found converging evidence dissociating SSA from sensory novelty and the MMN. First, during an oddball paradigm with frequency deviants, neuronal responses showed clear SSA but failed to encode novelty in a manner analogous to the human MMN. Second, oddball paradigms using intensity or duration deviants revealed a pattern of unit responses that showed sensory adaptation, but again without any measurable novelty correlates aligning to the human MMN. Finally NMDA antagonists, which are known to disrupt the MMN, suppressed the magnitude of multiunit responses in a nonspecific manner, leaving the process of SSA intact. Together, our results suggest that auditory novelty detection as indexed by the MMN is dissociable from SSA at the level of activity encoded by auditory cortex neurons. Further, the NMDA sensitivity reported for the MMN, which models the disruption of MMN observed in schizophrenia, may occur at a mechanistic locus outside of SSA.},

abstract = {In their pioneering studies of primary visual cortex, Hubel and Wiesel described the existence of two classes of cells, which they termed "simple" and "complex". The original classification scheme was based on a number of partly subjective tests of linear spatial summation. Later, investigators adopted an objective classification method based on the ratio between the amplitude of the first harmonic of the response and the mean spike rate (or the F(1)/F(0) ratio) when the neuron is stimulated with drifting sinusoidal gratings. This measure is bimodally distributed over the population and divides neurons into two classes that correspond closely to the classical definition by Hubel and Wiesel. Here we show that a simple rectification model can predict the observed bimodal distribution of F(1)/F(0) in primary visual cortex when the distributions of the intracellular response modulation and mean are unimodal. Thus, contrary to common belief, the bimodality of F(1)/F(0) does not necessarily imply the existence of two discrete cell classes. Furthermore, in reviewing the literature, we find no independent support for a simple/complex dichotomy. These results suggest that the existence of two distinct neural populations in primary visual cortex, and the associated hierarchical model of receptive field organization, need to be re-evaluated.},

@article{Azzopardi1998,
abstract = {Some patients with damaged striate cortex have blindsight-the ability to discriminate unseen stimuli in their clinically blind visual field defects when forced-choice procedures are used. Blindsight implies a sharp dissociation between visual performance and visual awareness, but signal detection theory indicates that it might be indistinguishable from the behavior of normal subjects near the lower limit of conscious vision, where the dissociations could arise trivially from using different response criteria during clinical and forced-choice tests. We tested the latter possibility with a hemianopic subject during yes-no and forced-choice detection of static and moving targets. His response criterion differed significantly between yes-no and forced-choice responding, and the difference was sufficient to produce a blindsight-like dissociation with bias-sensitive measures of performance. When measured independently of bias, his sensitivity to static targets was greater in the forced-choice than in the yes-no task (unlike normal control subjects), but his sensitivity to moving targets did not differ. Differences in response criterion could therefore account for dissociations between yes-no and forced-choice detection of motion, but not of static pattern. The results explain why patients with blindsight are apparently more often "aware" of moving stimuli than of static stimuli. However, they also imply that blindsight is unlike normal vision near threshold, and that pattern- and motion-detection in blindsight may depend on different sets of neural mechanisms during yes-no and forced-choice tests.},

abstract = {Visual attention biases relevant processing in the visual system by amplifying relevant or attenuating irrelevant sensory input. A potential signature of the latter operation, referred to as surround attenuation, has recently been identified in the electromagnetic brain response of human observers performing visual search. It was found that a zone of attenuated cortical excitability surrounds the target when the search required increased spatial resolution for item discrimination. Here we address the obvious hypothesis that surround attenuation serves distractor suppression in the vicinity of the target where interference from irrelevant search items is maximal. To test this hypothesis, surround attenuation was assessed under conditions when the target was presented in isolation versus when it was surrounded by distractors. Surprisingly, substantial and indistinguishable surround attenuation was seen under both conditions, indicating that it reflects an attentional operation independent of the presence of distractors. Adding distractors in the target's surround, however, increased the amplitude of the N2pc-an evoked response known to index distractor competition in visual search. Moreover, adding distractors led to a topographical change of source activity underlying the N2pc toward earlier extrastriate areas. In contrast, the topography of reduced source activity due to surround attenuation remained unaltered with and without distractors in the target's surround. We conclude that surround attenuation is not a direct consequence of the attenuation of distractors in visual search and that it dissociates from attentional operations reflected by the N2pc. A theoretical framework is proposed that links both operations in a common model of top-down attentional selection in visual cortex.},

Brain activation in 12 men and 12 women was recorded while they rated their experience of emotional arousal in response to neutral and emotionally negative pictures. In a recognition memory test 3 weeks after scanning, highly emotional pictures were remembered best, and remembered better by women than by men. Men and women activated different neural circuits to encode stimuli effectively into memory even when the analysis was restricted to pictures rated equally arousing by both groups. Men activated significantly more structures than women in a network that included the right amygdala, whereas women activated significantly fewer structures in a network that included the left amygdala. Women had significantly more brain regions where activation correlated with both ongoing evaluation of emotional experience and with subsequent memory for the most emotionally arousing pictures. Greater overlap in brain regions sensitive to current emotion and contributing to subsequent memory may be a neural mechanism for emotions to enhance memory more powerfully in women than in men.},

abstract = {Even during well-calibrated cognitive tasks, successive brain responses to repeated identical stimulations are highly variable. The source of this variability is believed to reside mainly in fluctuations of the subject's cognitive "context" defined by his/her attentive state, spontaneous thought process, strategy to carry out the task, and so on... As these factors are hard to manipulate precisely, they are usually not controlled, and the variability is discarded by averaging techniques. We combined first-person data and the analysis of neural processes to reduce such noise. We presented the subjects with a three-dimensional illusion and recorded their electrical brain activity and their own report about their cognitive context. Trials were clustered according to these first-person data, and separate dynamical analyses were conducted for each cluster. We found that (i) characteristic patterns of endogenous synchrony appeared in frontal electrodes before stimulation. These patterns depended on the degree of preparation and the immediacy of perception as verbally reported. (ii) These patterns were stable for several recordings. (iii) Preparatory states modulate both the behavioral performance and the evoked and induced synchronous patterns that follow. (iv) These results indicated that first-person data can be used to detect and interpret neural processes.},

Change detection resulted in enhanced activity in the parietal and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex as well as category-selective regions of the extrastriate visual cortex (for example, fusiform gyrus for changing faces). Although change blindness resulted in some extrastriate activity, the dorsal activations were clearly absent. These results demonstrate the importance of parietal and dorsolateral frontal activations for conscious detection of changes in properties coded in the ventral visual pathway, and thus suggest a key involvement of dorsal-ventral interactions in visual awareness.},

abstract = {Just as the visual system parses complex scenes into identifiable objects, the auditory system must organize sound elements scattered in frequency and time into coherent "streams." Current neurocomputational theories of auditory streaming rely on tonotopic organization of the auditory system to explain the observation that sequential spectrally distant sound elements tend to form separate perceptual streams. Here, we show that spectral components that are well separated in frequency are no longer heard as separate streams if presented synchronously rather than consecutively. In contrast, responses from neurons in primary auditory cortex of ferrets show that both synchronous and asynchronous tone sequences produce comparably segregated responses along the tonotopic axis. The results argue against tonotopic separation per se as a neural correlate of stream segregation. Instead we propose a computational model of stream segregation that can account for the data by using temporal coherence as the primary criterion for predicting stream formation.},

To assist with selection, the auditory system structures the incoming input into streams, each of which ideally corresponds to a single source. Some authors have argued that this process of streaming is automatic and invariant, but recent evidence suggests it is affected by attention. In Experiments 1 and 2, it is shown that the effect of attention is not a general suppression of streaming on an unattended side of the ascending auditory pathway or in unattended frequency regions. Experiments 3 and 4 investigate the effect on streaming of physical gaps in the sequence and of brief switches in attention away from a sequence. The results demonstrate that after even short gaps or brief switches in attention, streaming is reset. The implications are discussed, and a hierarchical decomposition model is proposed.},

@article{Anderson2006,
abstract = {The auditory thalamus (medial geniculate body, MGB) receives its main ascending input from the inferior colliculus (IC), which was considered to be an obligatory relay for all auditory inputs to the MGB. However, recent anatomical evidence in the rat [ (Malmierca et al. 2002) J. Neurosci., 22, 10891-10897] has confirmed the presence of a direct pathway from the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) to the medial MGB, bypassing the IC, as previously suggested in the chimpanzee [ (Strominger et al. 1977) J. Comp. Neurol., 172, 349-366]. We show that this direct pathway is also present in the guinea pig and apparently results in short latency responses in the thalamus. Injection of anterograde tracer into the DCN of five adult guinea pigs revealed terminal boutons and axonal swellings distributed throughout the medial MGB, but absent from all other MGB subdivisions. Electrophysiological recordings made from 39 adult guinea pigs (24 male {\&} 15 female) showed neurons in the medial MGB responded with significantly shorter latencies to acoustic clicks (7.8 ms) than those from the ventral (11.0 ms), dorsal (14.4 ms), or shell (16.5 ms) MGB, consistent with the direct pathway from the DCN. The function of the direct pathway is not known but may be related to the fast responses and the role of the medial MGB in integrating combined somatosensory and auditory inputs. Short latency responses may be important in priming the auditory cortex to prepare it for rapid analysis and in recruiting the amygdala for rapid emotional responses such as fear.},

abstract = {We examined the nature and the selectivity of the motion deficits produced by lesions of extrastriate areas MT and MST. Lesions were made by injecting ibotenic acid into the representation of the left visual field in two macaque monkeys. The monkeys discriminated two stimuli that differed either in stimulus direction or orientation. Direction and orientation discrimination were assessed by measuring thresholds with gratings and random-dots placed in the intact or lesioned visual fields. At the start of behavioral testing, we found pronounced, motion-specific deficits in thresholds for all types of moving stimuli, including pronounced elevations in contrast thresholds and in signal-to-noise thresholds measured with moving gratings, as well as deficits in direction range thresholds and motion coherence measured with random-dot stimuli. In addition, the accuracy of direction discrimination was reduced at smaller spatial displacements (i.e. step sizes), suggesting an increase in spatial scale of the residual directional mechanism. Subsequent improvements in thresholds were seen with all motion stimuli, as behavioral training progressed, and these improvements occurred only with extensive behavioral testing in the lesioned visual field. These improvements were particularly pronounced for stimuli not masked by noise. On the other hand, deficits in the ability to extract motion from noisy stimuli and in the accuracy of direction discrimination persisted despite extensive behavioral training. These results demonstrate the importance of areas MT and MST for the perception of motion direction, particularly in the presence of noise. In addition, they provide evidence for the importance of behavioral training for functional recovery after cortical lesions. The data also strongly support the idea of functional specialization of areas MT and MST for motion processing.},

abstract = {In this review we re-examine the concept of a cortical column in macaque primary visual cortex, and consider to what extent a functionally defined column reflects any sort of anatomical entity that subdivides cortical territory. Functional studies have shown that columns relating to different response properties are mapped in cortex at different spatial scales. We suggest that these properties first emerge in mid-layer 4C through a combination of thalamic afferent inputs and local intracortical circuitry, and are then transferred to other layers in a columnar fashion, via interlaminar relays, where additional processing occurs. However, several properties are not strictly columnar since they do not appear in all cortical layers. In contrast to the functional column, an anatomically based cortical column is defined most clearly in terms of the reciprocal connections it makes, both via intra-areal lateral connections and inter-areal feedback/feedforward pathways. The column boundaries are reinforced by interplay between lateral inhibition spreading beyond the column boundary and disinhibition within the column. The anatomical column acts as a functionally tuned unit and point of information collation from laterally offset regions and feedback pathways. Thalamic inputs provide the high-contrast receptive field sizes of the column's neurons, intra-areal lateral connections provide their low contrast summation field sizes, and feedback pathways provide surround modulation of receptive fields responses.},

We suggest how current developments in linguistics can be profitably wedded to work in evolutionary biology, anthropology, psychology, and neuroscience. We submit that a distinction should be made between the faculty of language in the broad sense (FLB) and in the narrow sense (FLN). FLB includes a sensory-motor system, a conceptual-intentional system, and the computational mechanisms for recursion, providing the capacity to generate an infinite range of expressions from a finite set of elements. We hypothesize that FLN only includes recursion and is the only uniquely human component of the faculty of language. We further argue that FLN may have evolved for reasons other than language, hence comparative studies might look for evidence of such computations outside of the domain of communication (for example, number, navigation, and social relations).},

The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias.

We found that TMS applied over the presupplementary motor area after the execution of a simple spontaneous action shifted the perceived onset of the motor intention backward in time, and shifted the perceived time of action execution forward in time. The size of the effect was similar regardless of whether TMS was applied immediately after the action or 200 msec after. The results of three control studies suggest that this effect is time-limited, specific to modality, and also specific to the anatomical site of stimulation. We conclude that the perceived onset of intention depends, at least in part, on neural activity that takes place after the execution of action. A model, which is based on the mechanism of cue integration under the presence of noise, is offered to explain the results. The implications for the conscious control of spontaneous actions are discussed.},

Here, we used a masked speech priming method in conjunction with a submillisecond interaural delay manipulation to contrast subliminal and supraliminal processing at constant prime, mask and target strength. This delay induced a perceptual streaming effect, with the prime popping out in the supraliminal condition. By manipulating the prime-target interval (ISI), we show a qualitatively distinct profile of priming longevity as a function of prime awareness. While subliminal priming disappeared after half a second, supraliminal priming was independent of ISI. This shows that the distinction between conscious and unconscious processing depends on high-level perceptual streaming factors rather than low-level features (energy, duration).},

abstract = {The controlled attention theory of working memory suggests that individuals with greater working memory capacity (WMC) are better able to control or focus their attention than individuals with lesser WMC. This relationship has been observed in a number of selective attention paradigms including a dichotic listening task (Conway, Cowan, {\&} Bunting, 2001) in which participants were required to shadow words presented to one ear and ignore words presented to the other ear. Conway et al. found that when the participant's name was presented to the ignored ear, 65{\%} of participants with low WMC reported hearing their name, compared to only 20{\%} of participants with high WMC, suggesting greater selective attention on the part of high WMC participants. In the present study, individual differences in divided attention were examined in a dichotic listening task, in which participants shadowed one message and listened for their own name in the other message. Here we find that 66.7{\%} of high WMC and 34.5{\%} of low WMC participants detected their name. These results suggest that as WMC capacity increases, so does the ability to control the focus of attention, with high WMC participants being able to flexibly "zoom in" or "zoom out" depending on task demands.},

Then we discuss dynamic aspects of neural activity, such as sustained versus phasic activity, feedforward versus reentrant activity, and the role of neural synchronization.

abstract = {In our complex acoustic environment, we are confronted with a mixture of sounds produced by several simultaneous sources. However, we rarely perceive these sounds as incomprehensible noise. Our brain uses perceptual organization processes to independently follow the emission of each sound source over time. If the acoustic properties exploited in these processes are well-established, the neurophysiological mechanisms involved in auditory scene analysis remain unclear and have recently raised more interest. Here, we review the studies investigating these mechanisms using electrophysiological recordings from the cochlear nucleus to the auditory cortex, in animals and humans. Their findings reveal that basic mechanisms such as frequency selectivity, forward suppression and multi-second habituation shape the automatic brain responses to sounds in a way that can account for several important characteristics of perceptual organization of both simultaneous and successive sounds. One challenging question remains unresolved: how are the resulting activity patterns integrated to yield the corresponding conscious percepts?},

@article{VanGaal2008,
abstract = {To further our understanding of the function of conscious experience we need to know which cognitive processes require awareness and which do not. Here, we show that an unconscious stimulus can trigger inhibitory control processes, commonly ascribed to conscious control mechanisms. We combined the metacontrast masking paradigm and the Go/No-Go paradigm to study whether unconscious No-Go signals can actively trigger high-level inhibitory control processes, strongly associated with the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Behaviorally, unconscious No-Go signals sometimes triggered response inhibition to the level of complete response termination and yielded a slow down in the speed of responses that were not inhibited. Electroencephalographic recordings showed that unconscious No-Go signals elicit two neural events: (1) an early occipital event and (2) a frontocentral event somewhat later in time. The first neural event represents the visual encoding of the unconscious No-Go stimulus, and is also present in a control experiment where the masked stimulus has no behavioral relevance. The second event is unique to the Go/No-Go experiment, and shows the subsequent implementation of inhibitory control in the PFC. The size of the frontal activity pattern correlated highly with the impact of unconscious No-Go signals on subsequent behavior. We conclude that unconscious stimuli can influence whether a task will be performed or interrupted, and thus exert a form of cognitive control. These findings challenge traditional views concerning the proposed relationship between awareness and cognitive control and stretch the alleged limits and depth of unconscious information processing.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a model that accounts quantitatively for a phenomenon of perceptual segregation, the simultaneous perception of more than one pitch in a single complex sound. The method is based on a characterization of the time-varying spike probability generated by a model of cochlear responses to sounds. It demonstrates how the autocorrelation theories of pitch perception contain the necessary elements to define a specific measure in the phase space of the simulated auditory nerve probability of firing time series. This measure was motivated in the first instance by the correlation dimension of the attractor; however, it has been modified in several ways in order to increase the neurobiological plausibility. This quantity characterizes each of the cochlear frequency channels and gives rise to a channel clustering criterion. The model computes the clusters and the pitch estimates simultaneously using the same processing mechanisms of delay lines; therefore, it respects the biological constraints in a similar way to temporal theories of pitch. The model successfully explains a wide range of perceptual experiments.},

Sound textures are distinguished by temporal homogeneity, suggesting they could be recognized with time-averaged statistics. To test this hypothesis, we processed real-world textures with an auditory model containing filters tuned for sound frequencies and their modulations, and measured statistics of the resulting decomposition. We then assessed the realism and recognizability of novel sounds synthesized to have matching statistics. Statistics of individual frequency channels, capturing spectral power and sparsity, generally failed to produce compelling synthetic textures; however, combining them with correlations between channels produced identifiable and natural-sounding textures. Synthesis quality declined if statistics were computed from biologically implausible auditory models. The results suggest that sound texture perception is mediated by relatively simple statistics of early auditory representations, presumably computed by downstream neural populations. The synthesis methodology offers a powerful tool for their further investigation.},

Fast-spiking inhibitory interneurons discharged strongly in relation to higher-frequency oscillations in the field potential in vivo and possess membrane, synaptic, and action potential properties that are advantageous for transmission of higher-frequency activity. Intracellular injection of synaptic conductances having the characteristics of the recorded EPSPs and IPSPs reveal that IPSPs are important in controlling the timing and probability of action potential generation in pyramidal cells.

Responses to low-level ({\textless} 10-20 dB SPL) characteristic-frequency (CF) tones (9-10 kHz) grow linearly with stimulus intensity and exhibit gains of 66-76 dB relative to stapes motion. At higher levels, CF responses grow monotonically at compressive rates, with input-output slopes as low as 0.2 dB/dB in the intensity range 40-80 dB. Compressive growth, which is significantly correlated with response sensitivity, is evident even at stimulus levels higher than 100 dB. Responses become rapidly linear as stimulus frequency departs from CF. As a result, at stimulus levels {\textgreater} 80 dB the largest responses are elicited by tones with frequency about 0.4-0.5 octave below CF. For stimulus frequencies well above CF, responses stop decreasing with increasing frequency: A plateau is reached. The compressive growth of responses to tones with frequency near CF is accompanied by intensity-dependent phase shifts.

abstract = {The autoradiographic tracing method has been used to identify the various descending tectofugal pathways and their targets in the rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta). The present data reveal that the majority of descending tectofugal axons arise from collicular laminae which lie ventral to the stratum opticum (layer 3). Such descending axons can be grouped into two major bundles or tracts, i.e., the ipsilateral tectopontine-tectobulbar tract and the crossed tectospinal tract (or the predorsal bundle). There is, in addition to these two major pathways, a smaller, commissural projection. The ipsilateral pathway courses laterally and ventrocaudally to terminate within the parabigeminal nucleus, the mesencephalic reticular formation, the dorsal lateral pontine gray (in several discrete patches), the dorsal lateral wing of the nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis, and within the nucleus reticularis pontis oralis. Other ipsilateral targets of the deep tectal layers are the cuneiform nucleus and the external nucleus of the inferior colliculus. In several experiments transported protein is also apparent within the substantia nigra. Axons which comprise the tectospinal tract, or the predorsal bundle, cross within the dorsal tegmental decussation and descend within the brainstem in a position slightly lateral to the midline. The most rostral and quite extensive target of the predorsal bundle is the nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis. As the predorsal bundle courses caudally within the pontine tegmentum, labeled axons enter the dorsal and medial regions of both the oral and the caudal divisions of the nucleus reticularis pontis. At caudal medullary levels, the mojority of the labeled axons comprising the predorsal bundle pass ventrally to end quite profusely with the subnucleus b of the medial accessory nucleus of the inferior olivary complex. Caudal to this only a few scattered, labeled axons can be followed into the cervical spinal cord. Labeled axons also pass to the opposite, or contralateral colliculus via the tectal commissure. Such axons appear to arise and end primarily within the deeper tectal layers. In one experiment, the injection invaded the mesencephalic nucleus of the trigeminal nerve. Labeled axons were apparent within the motor nucleus, the chief sensory nucleus (quite profusely) and within the spinal or descending nucleus of the trigeminal nerve.},

abstract = {1. We study the propagation and dynamics of spindle waves in thalamic slices by developing and analyzing a model of reciprocally coupled populations of excitatory thalamocortical (TC) neurons and inhibitory thalamic reticular (RE) neurons. 2. Each TC neuron has three intrinsic ionic currents: a low-threshold T-type Ca+2 current (ICa-T), a hyperpolarization-activated cation ("sag") current (Ih) and a leak current. Each RE cell also has three currents: ICa-T, a leak current, and a calcium-activated potassium current (IAHP). Isolated TC cells are at rest, can burst when released or depolarized from a hyperpolarized level, and burst rhythmically under moderate constant hyperpolarizing current. Isolated RE cells are at a hyperpolarized resting membrane potential and can burst when depolarized. 3. TC cells excite RE cells with fast alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) synapses, and RE cells inhibit TC cells with fast gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABAA) and slow GABAB synapses and inhibit each other with GABAA synapses only. GABAB postsynaptic conductances operate far from saturation, and the slow inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) increase with the width of the presynaptic burst. The model network is a one-dimensional cellular array with localized coupling. The synaptic coupling strength decays with the distance between the pre- and postsynaptic cells, either exponentially or as a step function. 4. The "intact" network can oscillate with partial synchrony and a population frequency of approximately 10 Hz. RE cells emit bursts almost at every oscillation cycle, whereas TC cells do so almost at every other cycle. Block of GABAB receptors hardly changes the network behavior. Block of GABAA receptors leads the network to a slowed oscillatory state, where the population frequency is approximately 4 Hz and both RE and TC cells fire unusually long bursts at every cycle and in full synchrony. These results are consistent with the experimental observations of von Krosigk, Bal, and McCormick. We obtain such consistency only when the above assumptions regarding the synaptic dynamics, particularly nonsaturating GABAB synapses, are fulfilled. 5. The slice model has a stable rest state with no neural activity. By initially depolarizing a few neurons at one end of the slice while all the other cells are at rest, a recruitment process may be initiated, and a wavefront of oscillatory activity propagates across the slice. Ahead of the wavefront, neurons are quiescent; neurons behind it oscillate. We find that the wave progresses forward in a lurching manner. TC cells that have just become inhibited must be hyperpolarized for a long enough time before they can fire rebound bursts and recruit RE cells. This step limits the wavefront velocity and may involve a substantial part of the cycle when no cells at the front are depolarized. 6. The wavefront velocity increases linearly with the characteristic spatial length of the connectivity (the footprint length). It increases only gradually with the synaptic strength, logarithmically in the case of an exponential connection function and only slightly for a step connection function. It also decreases gradually with a potassium leak conductance that hyperpolarizes RE cells. 7. To reproduce the experimentally measured wavefront velocity of approximately 1 mm/s, together with other in vitro observations, both the RE-to-TC and the TC-to-RE projections in the model should be spatially localized. The sum of the RE-to-TC and the TC-to-RE synaptic footprint lengths should be on the order of 100 microns. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

abstract = {The current focus of studies on neural entities for memory maintenance is on the interplay between fast neuronal oscillations in the gamma band and slow oscillations in the theta or delta band. The hierarchical coupling of slow and fast oscillations is crucial for the rehearsal of sensory inputs for short-term storage, as well as for binding sensory inputs that are represented in spatially segregated cortical areas. However, no experimental evidence for the binding of spatially segregated information has yet been presented for memory maintenance in humans. In the present study, we actively manipulated memory maintenance performance with an attentional blink procedure during human scalp electroencephalography (EEG) recordings and identified that slow oscillations are enhanced when memory maintenance is successful. These slow oscillations accompanied fast oscillations in the gamma frequency range that appeared at spatially segregated scalp sites. The amplitude of the gamma oscillation at these scalp sites was simultaneously enhanced at an EEG phase of the slow oscillation. Successful memory maintenance appears to be achieved by a rehearsal of sensory inputs together with a coordination of distributed fast oscillations at a preferred timing of the slow oscillations.},

abstract = {Synchronization of neuronal activity, often associated with network oscillations, is thought to provide a means for integrating anatomically distributed processing in the brain. Neuronal processing, however, involves simultaneous oscillations in various frequency bands. The mechanisms involved in the integration of such spectrally distributed processing have remained enigmatic. We demonstrate, using magnetoencephalography, that robust cross-frequency phase synchrony is present in the human cortex among oscillations with frequencies from 3 to 80 Hz. Continuous mental arithmetic tasks demanding the retention and summation of items in the working memory enhanced the cross-frequency phase synchrony among alpha (approximately 10 Hz), beta (approximately 20 Hz), and gamma (approximately 30-40 Hz) oscillations. These tasks also enhanced the "classical" within-frequency synchrony in these frequency bands, but the spatial patterns of alpha, beta, and gamma synchronies were distinct and, furthermore, separate from the patterns of cross-frequency phase synchrony. Interestingly, an increase in task load resulted in an enhancement of phase synchrony that was most prominent between gamma- and alpha-band oscillations. These data indicate that cross-frequency phase synchrony is a salient characteristic of ongoing activity in the human cortex and that it is modulated by cognitive task demands. The enhancement of cross-frequency phase synchrony among functionally and spatially distinct networks during mental arithmetic tasks posits it as a candidate mechanism for the integration of spectrally distributed processing.},

abstract = {Humans and other animals can attend to one of multiple sounds and follow it selectively over time. The neural underpinnings of this perceptual feat remain mysterious. Some studies have concluded that sounds are heard as separate streams when they activate well-separated populations of central auditory neurons, and that this process is largely pre-attentive. Here, we argue instead that stream formation depends primarily on temporal coherence between responses that encode various features of a sound source. Furthermore, we postulate that only when attention is directed towards a particular feature (e.g. pitch) do all other temporally coherent features of that source (e.g. timbre and location) become bound together as a stream that is segregated from the incoherent features of other sources.},

We used fMRI to examine neural responses when subjects experienced a tactile stimulus that was either self-produced or externally produced. More activity was found in somatosensory cortex when the stimulus was externally produced. In the cerebellum, less activity was associated with a movement that generated a tactile stimulus than with a movement that did not. This difference suggests that the cerebellum is involved in predicting the specific sensory consequences of movements, providing the signal that is used to cancel the sensory response to self-generated stimulation.},

@article{Schwartz2012,
abstract = {This special issue presents research concerning multistable perception in different sensory modalities. Multistability occurs when a single physical stimulus produces alternations between different subjective percepts. Multistability was first described for vision, where it occurs, for example, when different stimuli are presented to the two eyes or for certain ambiguous figures. It has since been described for other sensory modalities, including audition, touch and olfaction. The key features of multistability are: (i) stimuli have more than one plausible perceptual organization; (ii) these organizations are not compatible with each other. We argue here that most if not all cases of multistability are based on competition in selecting and binding stimulus information. Binding refers to the process whereby the different attributes of objects in the environment, as represented in the sensory array, are bound together within our perceptual systems, to provide a coherent interpretation of the world around us. We argue that multistability can be used as a method for studying binding processes within and across sensory modalities. We emphasize this theme while presenting an outline of the papers in this issue. We end with some thoughts about open directions and avenues for further research.},

While these issues have been examined fruitfully in isolation (e.g. Macoveanu et al. in Biol Cybern 96(4): 407-19, 2007), we address them here in tandem, with a focus on how distractibility and reward interact. In particular, we parameterise an observation model that embodies the nonlinear form of such interactions, as described in a recent neuronal network model (Gruber et al. in J Comput Neurosci 20:153-166, 2006). We observe that memory for a target stimulus can be corrupted by distracters in the delay period. Interestingly, in contrast to our theoretical predictions, this corruption was only partial. Distracters do not simply overwrite target; rather, a compromise is reached between target and distracter. Finally, we observed a trend towards a reduced distractibility under conditions of high reward. We discuss the implications of these findings for theoretical formulations of basal and dopamine (DA)-modulated neural bump- attractor networks of working memory.},

In the years since this original proposal, support for the perception-action hypothesis has come from neuroimaging experiments, human neuropsychology, monkey neurophysiology, and human psychophysical experiments. Indeed, some of the strongest support for this hypothesis has come from behavioural experiments showing that visually guided actions are largely refractory to perceptual illusions. Although controversial, the findings from this literature both support the original hypothesis and suggest important modifications. The ongoing challenge for neurobiologists is to map these behavioural findings onto their corresponding neural substrates.},

Quantitative validation of this model, however, is difficult because the precise noise characteristics and prior expectations are unknown. Here, we present an augmented observer model that accounts for the variability of subjective responses in a speed discrimination task. This allowed us to infer the shape of the prior probability as well as the internal noise characteristics directly from psychophysical data. For all subjects, we found that the fitted model provides an accurate description of the data across a wide range of stimulus parameters. The inferred prior distribution shows significantly heavier tails than a Gaussian, and the amplitude of the internal noise is approximately proportional to stimulus speed and depends inversely on stimulus contrast. The framework is general and should prove applicable to other experiments and perceptual modalities.},

abstract = {Contrast-dependent changes in spatial summation and contextual modulation of primary visual cortex (V1) neuron responses to stimulation of their receptive field reveal long-distance integration of visual signals within V1, well beyond the classical receptive field (cRF) of single neurons. To identify the cortical circuits mediating these long-distance computations, we have used a combination of anatomical and physiological recording methods to determine the spatial scale and retinotopic logic of intra-areal V1 horizontal connections and inter-areal feedback connections to V1. We have then compared the spatial scales of these connectional systems to the spatial dimensions of the cRF, spatial summation field (SF), and modulatory surround field of macaque V1 neurons. We find that monosynaptic horizontal connections within area V1 are of an appropriate spatial scale to mediate interactions within the SF of V1 neurons and to underlie contrast-dependent changes in SF size. Contrary to common beliefs, these connections cannot fully account for the dimensions of the surround field. The spatial scale of feedback circuits from extrastriate cortex to V1 is, instead, commensurate with the full spatial range of center-surround interactions. Thus these connections could represent an anatomical substrate for contextual modulation and global-to-local integration of visual signals. Feedback projections connect corresponding and equal-sized regions of the visual field in striate and extrastriate cortices and cover anisotropic parts of visual space, unlike V1 horizontal connections that are isotropic in the macaque. V1 isotropic connectivity demonstrates that anisotropic horizontal connections are not necessary to generate orientation selectivity. Anisotropic feedback connections may play a role in contour completion.},

These new data, along with physiological and imaging studies, now make it likely that the visual attributes of color, form, and motion are not neatly segregated by V1 into different stripe compartments in V2. Instead, there are just two main streams, originating from cytochrome oxidase patches and interpatches, that project to V2. Each stream is composed of a mixture of magno, parvo, and konio geniculate signals. Further studies are required to elucidate how the patches and interpatches differ in the output they convey to extrastriate cortex.},

@article{Huffman1990,
abstract = {In this review the following major points are emphasized. First, the descending auditory system includes 3 separate, but parallel pathways connecting the AC, MGB and IC. Each pathway makes a strong set of connections with a distinctive area from each of 3 auditory centers. The three sets of connections are mutually exclusive, such that the pathways describe 3 separate corticocolliculo-geniculate systems. Thus, multiple feedback loops between the AC and the IC are formed which create a great capacity for parallel processing of auditory information. Second, the IC projects to the SOC and, in particular, to the source of olivocochlear efferent neurons. The connections of the IC with the AC rostrally, and with the olivocochlear neurons caudally, imply a descending trisynaptic pathway from the cortex to the cochlea whose travel time could better that of the ascending pathway and thus provide an efficient feedback mechanism. It is probable that the IC influences cochlear signal processing. The reciprocal connectivity between any two of either the IC, SOC or the CN, again, affords to the auditory system remarkable parallel processing capabilities. Finally, the descending auditory, and 'extra-auditory' connections of the IC bestow a functional separateness to the 3 nuclei of the IC, a view that is best illustrated by description of the ICX as an acousticomotor nucleus, having connections with the SC, cerebellum and somatosensory and vocalization systems. More sophisticated questions about the descending auditory system will incorporate these present observations and test functional implications to which they allude.},

abstract = {Cortical gamma oscillations (20-80 Hz) predict increases in focused attention, and failure in gamma regulation is a hallmark of neurological and psychiatric disease. Current theory predicts that gamma oscillations are generated by synchronous activity of fast-spiking inhibitory interneurons, with the resulting rhythmic inhibition producing neural ensemble synchrony by generating a narrow window for effective excitation. We causally tested these hypotheses in barrel cortex in vivo by targeting optogenetic manipulation selectively to fast-spiking interneurons. Here we show that light-driven activation of fast-spiking interneurons at varied frequencies (8-200 Hz) selectively amplifies gamma oscillations. In contrast, pyramidal neuron activation amplifies only lower frequency oscillations, a cell-type-specific double dissociation. We found that the timing of a sensory input relative to a gamma cycle determined the amplitude and precision of evoked responses. Our data directly support the fast-spiking-gamma hypothesis and provide the first causal evidence that distinct network activity states can be induced in vivo by cell-type-specific activation.},

abstract = {In everyday life we continually need to detect signals against a background of interfering noise (the "cocktail party effect"): a task that is much easier to accomplish using two ears. The binaural masking level difference (BMLD) measures the ability of listeners to use a difference in binaural attributes to segregate sound sources and thus improve their discriminability against interfering noises. By computing the detectability of tones from rate-versus-level functions in the presence of a suprathreshold noise, we previously demonstrated that individual low-frequency delay-sensitive neurons in the inferior colliculus are able to show BMLDs. Here we consider the responses of a population of such neurons when the noise level is held constant (as conventionally in psychophysical paradigms). We have sampled the responses of 121 units in the inferior colliculi of five guinea pigs to identical noise and 500 Hz tones at both ears (NoSo) and to identical noise but with the 500 Hz tone at one ear inverted (NoSpi). The result suggests that the neurons subserving detection of So tones in No (identical noise at the two ears) noise are those neurons with best frequencies (BFs) close to 500 Hz that respond to So tones with an increase in their discharge rate from that attributable to the noise. The detection of the inverted (Spi) signal is also attributable to neurons with BFs close to 500 Hz. However, among these neurons, the presence of the Spi tone was indicated by an increased discharge rate in some neurons and by a decreased discharge rate in others.},

@article{Hupe2012,
abstract = {Auditory streaming and visual plaids have been used extensively to study perceptual organization in each modality. Both stimuli can produce bistable alternations between grouped (one object) and split (two objects) interpretations. They also share two peculiar features: (i) at the onset of stimulus presentation, organization starts with a systematic bias towards the grouped interpretation; (ii) this first percept has 'inertia'; it lasts longer than the subsequent ones. As a result, the probability of forming different objects builds up over time, a landmark of both behavioural and neurophysiological data on auditory streaming. Here we show that first percept bias and inertia are independent. In plaid perception, inertia is due to a depth ordering ambiguity in the transparent (split) interpretation that makes plaid perception tristable rather than bistable: experimental manipulations removing the depth ambiguity suppressed inertia. However, the first percept bias persisted. We attempted a similar manipulation for auditory streaming by introducing level differences between streams, to bias which stream would appear in the perceptual foreground. Here both inertia and first percept bias persisted. We thus argue that the critical common feature of the onset of perceptual organization is the grouping bias, which may be related to the transition from temporally/spatially local to temporally/spatially global computation.},

Taking this concept further, we review experiments showing that oscillatory phenomena such as alpha, theta, and delta responses to events are, just as the gamma band, strongly interwoven with sensory and cognitive functions. This review argues that selectively distributed delta, theta, alpha and gamma oscillatory systems act as resonant communication networks through large populations of neurons. Thus, oscillatory processes might play a major role in functional communication in the brain in relation to memory and integrative functions.},

abstract = {Perceptual grouping of successive frequency components, namely, auditory streaming, is essential for auditory scene analysis. Prolonged listening to an unchanging triplet-tone sequence produces a series of illusory switches between a single coherent stream (S1) and two distinct streams (S2). The predominant percept depends on the frequency difference (Deltaf) between high and low tones. Here, we combined the use of different Deltafs with an event-related fMRI design to identify whether the temporal dynamics of brain activity differs depending on the direction of perceptual switches. The results demonstrated that the activity of the medial geniculate body (MGB) in the thalamus occurred earlier during switching from nonpredominant to predominant percepts, whereas that of the auditory cortex (AC) occurred earlier during switching from predominant to nonpredominant percepts, regardless of Deltaf. The asymmetry of temporal precedence indicates that the MGB and AC activations play different roles in perceptual switching and depend on perceptual predominance rather than on S1 and S2 percepts per se. Our results suggest that feedforward and feedback processes in the thalamocortical loop are involved in the formation of percepts in auditory streaming.},

abstract = {We investigate self-sustaining stable states (attractors) in networks of integrate-and-fire neurons. First, we study the stability of spontaneous activity in an unstructured network. It is shown that the stochastic background activity, of 1-5 spikes/s, is unstable if all neurons are excitatory. On the other hand, spontaneous activity becomes self-stabilizing in presence of local inhibition, given reasonable values of the parameters of the network. Second, in a network sustaining physiological spontaneous rates, we study the effect of learning in a local module, expressed in synaptic modifications in specific populations of synapses. We find that if the average synaptic potentiation (LTP) is too low, no stimulus specific activity manifests itself in the delay period. Instead, following the presentation and removal of any stimulus there is, in the local module, a delay activity in which all neurons selective (responding visually) to any of the stimuli presented for learning have rates which gradually increase with the amplitude of synaptic potentiation. When the average LTP increases beyond a critical value, specific local attractors (stable states) appear abruptly against the background of the global uniform spontaneous attractor. In this case the local module has two available types of collective delay activity: if the stimulus is unfamiliar, the activity is spontaneous; if it is similar to a learned stimulus, delay activity is selective. These new attractors reflect the synaptic structure developed during learning. In each of them a small population of neurons have elevated rates, which depend on the strength of LTP. The remaining neurons of the module have their activity at spontaneous rates. The predictions made in this paper could be checked by single unit recordings in delayed response experiments.},

Today this region is the focus of an enormous amount of research, including work on such complex phenomena as regret, ambiguity, and willingness to pay. The orbitofrontal cortex is also credited as a major player in a host of neuropsychiatric diseases. This transformation arguably began with the application of concepts derived from animal learning theory. We will review data from studies emphasizing these approaches to argue that the orbitofrontal cortex forms a crucial part of a network of structures that signals information about expected outcomes. Further we will suggest that, within this network, the orbitofrontal cortex provides the critical ability to integrate information in real-time to make what amounts to actionable predictions or estimates about future outcomes. As we will show, the influence of these estimates can be demonstrated experimentally in appropriate behavioral settings, and their operation can also readily explain the role of orbitofrontal cortex in much more complex phenomena such as those cited above.},

@article{Buckner2000,
abstract = {Changes in human brain activity associated with repetition priming during word generation were characterized across a series of neuroimaging and behavioural studies. Repetition priming was consistently observed behaviourally as a decrease in response latency for repeated items, and was found for both visually and aurally cued word-generation tasks. Brain imaging using whole-brain functional MRI identified neural correlates of these effects. The principal effect of priming was to reduce neural activity within regions that were already being used to perform the word-generation tasks. Repeated word generation in response to visual cues was correlated with anatomically selective reductions in activity within the left frontal cortex along the inferior frontal gyrus and inferior temporal regions and, to a lesser degree, in specific earlier visual regions. These reductions were reversed when new items were presented, indicating that they were item-specific. Repeated word generation in response to aural cues also showed anatomically selective activity reductions within the left frontal and inferior temporal regions, indicating that these activity reductions were not dependent on the perceptual modality of the cue. The auditory cortex showed minimal repetition-related reductions. The presence of activity within left frontal regions that decreases as a function of item repetition for both visual and auditory cues suggests that these reductions may underlie an amodal repetition-priming effect existing at processing stages involving lexical/semantic search and access. The surprising finding that activity reductions in the inferior temporal cortex can be linked to repetition of either visual or auditory cues further suggests that these regions may be modulated in a top-down fashion during repetition priming, independent of (or in parallel with) stimulus-driven perceptual processes. Taken collectively, the data converge on a neural correlate of lexical/semantic priming. Amodal lexical/semantic processes, which may be triggered initially by modality-specific cues, proceed via an interaction between frontal and posterior brain regions. These interdependent regions show activity reductions that correlate with facilitated task performance when items are repeated.},

abstract = {Temporal coding in the auditory nerve is strikingly transformed in the cochlear nucleus. In contrast to fibers in the auditory nerve, some neurons in the cochlear nucleus can show "picket fence" phase-locking to low-frequency pure tones: they fire a precisely timed action potential at every cycle of the stimulus. Such synchronization enhancement and entrainment is particularly prominent in neurons with the spherical and globular morphology, described by Osen [Osen KK (1969) Cytoarchitecture of the cochlear nuclei in the cat. J Comp Neurol 136:453-483]. These neurons receive large axosomatic terminals from the auditory nerve--the end bulbs and modified end bulbs of Held--and project to binaural comparator nuclei in the superior olivary complex. The most popular model to account for picket fence phase-locking is monaural coincidence detection. This mechanism is plausible for globular neurons, which receive a large number of inputs. We draw attention to the existence of enhanced phase-locking and entrainment in spherical neurons, which receive too few end-bulb inputs from the auditory nerve to make a coincidence detection of end-bulb firings a plausible mechanism of synchronization enhancement.},

abstract = {People need to predict what other people will do, and the other person's perceived disposition is the preferred mode of prediction. People less often use, for example, shared social norms to explain another person's behavior. Social psychology's last half-century of research on attribution theory offers precise, validated paradigms for testing how people think about other people's minds. Neuro-imaging data from one classic attribution paradigm shows the unique priority given to inferring chronic, idiosyncratic dispositions (unique attitudes, individual personality, idiosyncratic intent), compared to other kinds of mental contents. Specifically, sentences describing behavior that is low in consensus across actors, low in distinctiveness across entities, and high in consistency over time (compared with the other 7 low-high combinations) uniquely elicits (a) person attributions and (b) activation in the superior temporal sulcus. Ignoring consensus, both low-distinctiveness, high-consistency combinations (compared to 6 remaining combinations) also activate the MPFC, consistent with decades of behavioral data showing that general social cognition neglects consensus information. Thus, activated areas converge with prior neuro-imaging data on theory of mind and social cognition, but more precisely isolate the exact nature of the inferences that activate these areas.},

abstract = {How can we disentangle the neural basis of phenomenal consciousness from the neural machinery of the cognitive access that underlies reports of phenomenal consciousness? We see the problem in stark form if we ask how we can tell whether representations inside a Fodorian module are phenomenally conscious. The methodology would seem straightforward: Find the neural natural kinds that are the basis of phenomenal consciousness in clear cases--when subjects are completely confident and we have no reason to doubt their authority--and look to see whether those neural natural kinds exist within Fodorian modules. But a puzzle arises: Do we include the machinery underlying reportability within the neural natural kinds of the clear cases? If the answer is "Yes," then there can be no phenomenally conscious representations in Fodorian modules. But how can we know if the answer is "Yes"? The suggested methodology requires an answer to the question it was supposed to answer! This target article argues for an abstract solution to the problem and exhibits a source of empirical data that is relevant, data that show that in a certain sense phenomenal consciousness overflows cognitive accessibility. I argue that we can find a neural realizer of this overflow if we assume that the neural basis of phenomenal consciousness does not include the neural basis of cognitive accessibility and that this assumption is justified (other things being equal) by the explanations it allows.},

Today BMIs designed for both experimental and clinical studies can translate raw neuronal signals into motor commands that reproduce arm reaching and hand grasping movements in artificial actuators. Clearly, these developments hold promise for the restoration of limb mobility in paralyzed subjects. However, as we review here, before this goal can be reached several bottlenecks have to be passed. These include designing a fully implantable biocompatible recording device, further developing real-time computational algorithms, introducing a method for providing the brain with sensory feedback from the actuators, and designing and building artificial prostheses that can be controlled directly by brain-derived signals. By reaching these milestones, future BMIs will be able to drive and control revolutionary prostheses that feel and act like the human arm.},

We compared the ability of two well-studied Herpes simplex virus (HSV) strains to be transported in the anterograde direction in the hamster visual system: strain McIntyre, representing HSV-1, and strain 186, representing HSV-2. Intravitreal injection of HSV-2 labeled more retinorecipient neurons than did HSV-1, suggesting important type differences in the ability of HSV to infect retinorecipient neurons after intravitreal injection. The most likely explanation for our results is that HSV-2 is more efficiently adsorbed than HSV-1 in the retinal ganglion cells. Our results also suggest that HSV may be useful as an anterograde transneuronal tracer for neuroanatomical studies of the visual system.},

abstract = {The extrastriate visual cortex can be divided into functionally distinct temporal and parietal regions, which have been implicated in feature-related ('what') and spatial ('where') vision, respectively. Neuropsychological studies of patients with damage to either the temporal or the parietal regions provide support for this functional distinction. Given the prevailing modular theoretical framework and the fact that prefrontal cortex receives inputs from both temporal and parietal streams, recent studies have focused on the role of prefrontal cortex in understanding where and how information about object identity is integrated with (or remains segregated from) information about object location. Here we show that many neurons in primate posterior parietal cortex (the 'where' pathway) show sensory shape selectivities to simple, two-dimensional geometric shapes while the animal performs a simple fixation task. In a delayed match-to-sample paradigm, many neuronal units also show significant differences in delay-period activity, and these differences depend on the shape of the sample. These results indicate that units in posterior parietal cortex contribute to attending to and remembering shape features in a way that is independent of eye movements, reaching, or object manipulation. These units show shape selectivity equivalent to any shown in the ventral pathway.},

We compare monoptic visual masking activation, which we find within all retinotopic visual areas, with dichoptic masking activation, which we find only in those retinotopic areas downstream of V2. Because monoptic and dichoptic masking are equivalent in magnitude perceptually, the present results establish a lower bound for maintenance of visual awareness of simple unattended targets. Moreover, we find that awareness-correlated circuits for simple targets are restricted to the occipital lobe. This finding provides evidence of an upper boundary in the visual hierarchy for visual awareness of simple unattended targets, thus constraining the location of circuits that maintain the visibility of simple targets to occipital areas beyond V1/V2.},

In Experiment 1 priming of the goal to perform well caused participants to perform comparatively better on an intellectual task. In Experiment 2 priming of the goal to cooperate caused participants to replenish a commonly held resource more readily. Experiment 3 used a dissociation paradigm to rule out perceptual-construal alternative explanations. Experiments 4 and 5 demonstrated that action guided by nonconsciously activated goals manifests two classic content-free features of the pursuit of consciously held goals.

abstract = {Humans can perceive illusory or subjective contours in the absence of any real physical boundaries. We used an adaptation protocol to look for orientation-selective neural responses to illusory contours defined by phase-shifted abutting line gratings in the human visual cortex. We measured functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) responses to illusory-contour test stimuli after adapting to an illusory-contour adapter stimulus that was oriented parallel or orthogonal to the test stimulus. We found orientation-selective adaptation to illusory contours in early (V1 and V2) and higher-tier visual areas (V3, hV4, VO1, V3A/B, V7, LO1, and LO2). That is, fMRI responses were smaller for test stimuli parallel to the adapter than for test stimuli orthogonal to the adapter. In two control experiments using spatially jittered and phase-randomized stimuli, we demonstrated that this adaptation was not just in response to differences in the distribution of spectral power in the stimuli. Orientation-selective adaptation to illusory contours increased from early to higher-tier visual areas. Thus, both early and higher-tier visual areas contain neurons selective for the orientation of this type of illusory contour.},

@article{Tononi2004a,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Consciousness poses two main problems. The first is understanding the conditions that determine to what extent a system has conscious experience. For instance, why is our consciousness generated by certain parts of our brain, such as the thalamocortical system, and not by other parts, such as the cerebellum? And why are we conscious during wakefulness and much less so during dreamless sleep? The second problem is understanding the conditions that determine what kind of consciousness a system has. For example, why do specific parts of the brain contribute specific qualities to our conscious experience, such as vision and audition? PRESENTATION OF THE HYPOTHESIS: This paper presents a theory about what consciousness is and how it can be measured. According to the theory, consciousness corresponds to the capacity of a system to integrate information. This claim is motivated by two key phenomenological properties of consciousness: differentiation - the availability of a very large number of conscious experiences; and integration - the unity of each such experience. The theory states that the quantity of consciousness available to a system can be measured as the Phi value of a complex of elements. Phi is the amount of causally effective information that can be integrated across the informational weakest link of a subset of elements. A complex is a subset of elements with Phi{\textgreater}0 that is not part of a subset of higher Phi. The theory also claims that the quality of consciousness is determined by the informational relationships among the elements of a complex, which are specified by the values of effective information among them. Finally, each particular conscious experience is specified by the value, at any given time, of the variables mediating informational interactions among the elements of a complex. TESTING THE HYPOTHESIS: The information integration theory accounts, in a principled manner, for several neurobiological observations concerning consciousness. As shown here, these include the association of consciousness with certain neural systems rather than with others; the fact that neural processes underlying consciousness can influence or be influenced by neural processes that remain unconscious; the reduction of consciousness during dreamless sleep and generalized seizures; and the time requirements on neural interactions that support consciousness. IMPLICATIONS OF THE HYPOTHESIS: The theory entails that consciousness is a fundamental quantity, that it is graded, that it is present in infants and animals, and that it should be possible to build conscious artifacts.},

abstract = {Receptive field properties of 147 neurons histologically verified to be located in area V3 were investigated during semichronic recording from paralyzed anesthetized macaque monkeys. Quantitative analyses were made of neuron selectivities for direction, orientation, speed, binocular disparity, and color. The majority of neurons in V3 (76{\%}) were strongly orientation selective; 40{\%} demonstrated strong direction selectivity. Most cells were tuned for stimulus speed and almost half showed optimum responses at 16 degrees/s. The distribution of optimum speeds ranged primarily from 4 to 32 degrees/s. Several cells in V3 displayed multi-peaked orientation- and/or direction-tuning curves. These cells had two or more narrowly tuned peaks that were not co-axial. In some ways, they resemble higher-order hypercomplex cells of cat area 19 and may subserve a higher level of form or motion analysis than is seen at antecedent visual areas. Roughly half (45{\%}) of the cells were selective for binocular disparity. Approximately half of these were tuned excitatory in that they showed weak responses when tested through either eye alone, but showed strong binocular facilitation centered on the fixation plane. The other disparity-selective cells were tuned inhibitory or asymmetric in their responses in front and behind the fixation plane. Contrary to previous reports, approximately 20{\%} of the neurons in V3 were color selective in terms of showing a severalfold greater response to the best monochromatic wavelength compared with the worst. Color-tuning curves of the subset of color selective cells had, on average, a full bandwidth at half maximum response of 80-100 nm. A comparison of the receptive field properties of neurons in V3 to those in other areas of visual cortex suggests that V3, like MT, is well suited for the analysis of several aspects of stimulus motion. V3 may also be involved in some aspects of form analysis, particularly at low contrast levels. Comparison with area VP, a thin strip of cortex anterior to ventral V2, which was previously considered part of V3, indicates that direction selectivity is much more prevalent in V3 than in VP. Conversely, color-selective cells are the majority in VP but a minority in V3. This suggests that visual information is processed differently in the upper and lower visual fields.},

Here we test the hypothesis that the mOFC is more concerned with reward-guided decision making, in contrast with the lOFC's role in reward-guided learning. Macaques performed three-armed bandit tasks and the effects of selective mOFC lesions were contrasted against lOFC lesions. First, we present analyses that make it possible to measure reward-credit assignment-a crucial component of reward-value learning-independently of the decisions animals make. The mOFC lesions do not lead to impairments in reward-credit assignment that are seen after lOFC lesions. Second, we examined how the reward values of choice options were compared. We present three analyses, one of which examines reward-guided decision making independently of reward-value learning. Lesions of the mOFC, but not the lOFC, disrupted reward-guided decision making. Impairments after mOFC lesions were a function of the multiple option contexts in which decisions were made. Contrary to axiomatic assumptions of decision theory, the mOFC-lesioned animals' value comparisons were no longer independent of irrelevant alternatives.},

In a recent critique of subliminal priming, Pratte and Rouder (Attention, Perception, {\&} Psychophysics, 71, 1276-1283, 2009) suggested that previous claims of subliminal priming may have been due to a failure to control the task difficulty between the experiment proper and the prime-classification task. Essentially, because the prime-classification task is more difficult than the experiment proper, the prime-classification task results may underrepresent the subjects' true ability to perceive the prime stimuli. To address this possibility, prime words were here presented in color. In the experiment proper, priming was observed. In the prime-classification task, subjects reported the color of the primes very accurately, indicating almost perfect control of task difficulty, but they could not identify the primes. Thus, I conclude that controlling for task difficulty does not eliminate subliminal priming.},

abstract = {Many sound sources can only be recognised from the pattern of sounds they emit, and not from the individual sound events that make up their emission sequences. Auditory scene analysis addresses the difficult task of interpreting the sound world in terms of an unknown number of discrete sound sources (causes) with possibly overlapping signals, and therefore of associating each event with the appropriate source. There are potentially many different ways in which incoming events can be assigned to different causes, which means that the auditory system has to choose between them. This problem has been studied for many years using the auditory streaming paradigm, and recently it has become apparent that instead of making one fixed perceptual decision, given sufficient time, auditory perception switches back and forth between the alternatives-a phenomenon known as perceptual bi- or multi-stability. We propose a new model of auditory scene analysis at the core of which is a process that seeks to discover predictable patterns in the ongoing sound sequence. Representations of predictable fragments are created on the fly, and are maintained, strengthened or weakened on the basis of their predictive success, and conflict with other representations. Auditory perceptual organisation emerges spontaneously from the nature of the competition between these representations. We present detailed comparisons between the model simulations and data from an auditory streaming experiment, and show that the model accounts for many important findings, including: the emergence of, and switching between, alternative organisations; the influence of stimulus parameters on perceptual dominance, switching rate and perceptual phase durations; and the build-up of auditory streaming. The principal contribution of the model is to show that a two-stage process of pattern discovery and competition between incompatible patterns can account for both the contents (perceptual organisations) and the dynamics of human perception in auditory streaming.},

abstract = {Perceptually ambiguous stimuli are useful for testing psychological and neuronal models of perceptual organization, e.g. for studying brain processes that underlie sequential segregation and integration. This is because the same stimuli may give rise to different subjective experiences. For humans, a tone sequence that alternates between a low-frequency and a high-frequency tone is perceptually bistable, and can be perceived as one or two streams. In the current study we present a new method based on response times (RTs) which allows identification ambiguous and unambiguous stimuli for subjects who cannot verbally report their subjective experience. We required two macaque monkeys (macaca fascicularis) to detect the termination of a sequence of light flashes which were either presented alone, or synchronized in different ways with a sequence of alternating low and high tones. We found that the monkeys responded faster to the termination of the flash sequence when the tone sequence terminated shortly before the flash sequence and thus predicted the termination of the flash sequence. This RT gain depended on the frequency separation of the tones. RT gains were largest when the frequency separation was small and the tones were presumably heard mainly as one stream. RT gains were smallest when the frequency separation was large and the tones were presumably mainly heard as two streams. RT gain was of intermediate size for intermediate frequency separations. Similar results were obtained from human subjects. We conclude that the observed RT gains reflect the perceptual organization of the tone sequence, and that tone sequences with an intermediate frequency separation, as for humans, are perceptually ambiguous for monkeys.},

The probability of hearing tem poral coherence decreased steadily over tim e as adaptation built up. Probability of tem poral coherence fell off linearly as a function of log m odulation rate (over the range from about 2-10 c/s) and of log tonal interval (from about a semitone to an octave). Adapting to one center audiofrequency and testing at another showed that the adaptation was frequency-tuned with a bandwidth comparable to one critical band. Adapting one ear and testing the other showed no interaural transfer of the adaptation. Analogically, a tone jum ping between two audiofre- quencies is like a visual spot jum ping between two positions and (an instance of comparable adaptation) changing gradually from apparent motion to apparent flicker.},

Mammalian species generally have multiple visual field maps with each species having similar, but not identical, maps.

Evidence is accumulating for additional maps, including some in the frontal lobe. Cortical maps are arranged into clusters in which several maps have parallel eccentricity representations, while the angular representations within a cluster alternate in visual field sign. Visual field maps have been linked to functional and perceptual properties of the visual system at various spatial scales, ranging from the level of individual maps to map clusters to dorsal-ventral streams. We survey recent measurements of human visual field maps, describe hypotheses about the function and relationships between maps, and consider methods to improve map measurements and characterize the response properties of neurons comprising these maps.},

These neurons are involved in direction perception, but it is not clear how perceptual decisions are related to the population response. We recorded the activities of MT neurons in rhesus monkeys while they discriminated closely related directions, and examined the relationship between the activities of neurons tuned to different directions and the monkeys' choices. Perceptual decisions were significantly correlated with the activities of the highest-precision neurons but not with those of the lowest-precision neurons. The combined performance of the high-precision neurons matched the monkeys' behavior, whereas the ability to predict behavior based on the entire active population was poor. These results suggest that fine discrimination decisions are crucially dependent on the activities of the most informative neurons.},

@article{Desimone1996,
abstract = {Recent studies show that neuronal mechanisms for learning and memory both dynamically modulate and permanently alter the representations of visual stimuli in the adult monkey cortex. Three commonly observed neuronal effects in memory-demanding tasks are repetition suppression, enhancement, and delay activity. In repetition suppression, repeated experience with the same visual stimulus leads to both short- and long-term suppression of neuronal responses in subpopulations of visual neurons. Enhancement works in an opposite fashion, in that neuronal responses are enhanced for objects with learned behavioral relevance. Delay activity is found in tasks in which animals are required to actively hold specific information "on-line" for short periods. Repetition suppression appears to be an intrinsic property of visual cortical areas such as inferior temporal cortex and is thought to be important for perceptual learning and priming. By contrast, enhancement and delay activity may depend on feedback to temporal cortex from prefrontal cortex and are thought to be important for working memory. All of these mnemonic effects on neuronal responses bias the competitive interactions that take place between stimulus representations in the cortex when there is more than one stimulus in the visual field. As a result, memory will often determine the winner of these competitions and, thus, will determine which stimulus is attended.},

abstract = {In recent years, cognitive neuroscientists have taken great advantage of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) as a non-invasive method of measuring neuronal activity in the human brain. But what exactly does fMRI tell us? We know that its signals arise from changes in local haemodynamics that, in turn, result from alterations in neuronal activity, but exactly how neuronal activity, haemodynamics and fMRI signals are related is unclear. It has been assumed that the fMRI signal is proportional to the local average neuronal activity, but many factors can influence the relationship between the two. A clearer understanding of how neuronal activity influences the fMRI signal is needed if we are correctly to interpret functional imaging data.},

We have developed a novel search algorithm, used it to search the Drosophila genomic sequence database, and identified a large multigene family encoding seven transmembrane domain proteins that are expressed in olfactory organs. We show that expression is restricted to subsets of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) for a number of these genes. Different members of the family initiate expression at different times during antennal development. Some of the genes are not expressed in a mutant of the Acj6 POU-domain transcription factor, a mutant in which a subset of ORNs show abnormal odorant specificities.},

abstract = {Mirror neurons are a distinct class of neurons that discharge both during the execution of a motor act and during observation of the same or similar motor act performed by another individual. However, the extent to which mirror neurons coding a motor act with a specific goal (e.g., grasping) might also respond to the observation of a motor act having the same goal, but achieved with artificial effectors, is not yet established. In the present study, we addressed this issue by recording mirror neurons from the ventral premotor cortex (area F5) of two monkeys trained to grasp objects with pliers. Neuron activity was recorded during the observation and execution of grasping performed with the hand, with pliers and during observation of an experimenter spearing food with a stick. The results showed that virtually all neurons responding to the observation of hand grasping also responded to the observation of grasping with pliers and, many of them to the observation of spearing with a stick. However, the intensity and pattern of the response differed among conditions. Hand grasping observation determined the earliest and the strongest discharge, while pliers grasping and spearing observation triggered weaker responses at longer latencies. We conclude that F5 grasping mirror neurons respond to the observation of a family of stimuli leading to the same goal. However, the response pattern depends upon the similarity between the observed motor act and the one executed by the hand, the natural motor template.},

abstract = {Transmission across neocortical synapses depends on the frequency of presynaptic activity (Thomson {\&} Deuchars, 1994). Interpyramidal synapses in layer V exhibit fast depression of synaptic transmission, while other types of synapses exhibit facilitation of transmission. To study the role of dynamic synapses in network computation, we propose a unified phenomenological model that allows computation of the postsynaptic current generated by both types of synapses when driven by an arbitrary pattern of action potential (AP) activity in a presynaptic population. Using this formalism, we analyze different regimes of synaptic transmission and demonstrate that dynamic synapses transmit different aspects of the presynaptic activity depending on the average presynaptic frequency. The model also allows for derivation of mean-field equations, which govern the activity of large, interconnected networks. We show that the dynamics of synaptic transmission results in complex sets of regular and irregular regimes of network activity.},

Young infants showed reduced sensitivity for all frequencies, and a reduced range of detectable frequencies. Sensitivity to high and low frequencies developed at different rates, but the shape of the temporal contrast sensitivity function did not change significantly with age. Temporal contrast sensitivity matures earlier than spatial contrast sensitivity. The development of high, but not low, frequency sensitivity may be limited by maturation of the magnocellular pathway.},

abstract = {The high-frequency limit of phase-locking has been measured in fibres of the auditory nerve in the guinea-pig. It is shown that phase-locking begins to decline at about 600 Hz and is no longer detectable above 3.5 kHz which is about 1 octave lower than in the cat, squirrel monkey and some birds. Direct measurements of the cochlear afferent fibre synaptic delay are consistent with indirect estimates from phase-locking, both giving values of 0.7-0.8 ms. Measurements of the receptor potentials of inner hair-cells in the guinea pig cochlea indicate that as the stimulus frequency is increased there is a progressive decrease in the a.c. component compared to the steady depolarization. The cause of this decline is the low-pass filtering of the a.c. component by the hair-cell membrane. The cut-off and slope of the decline in the a.c. component is consistent with the suggestion that this process is the limiting factor in cochlear nerve fibre phase-locking. The implications of these findings for interspecies variation in phase-locking cut-off, for cochlear mechanisms and for the encoding of complex sounds are discussed.},

abstract = {The auditory neural code must serve a wide range of auditory tasks that require great sensitivity in time and frequency and be effective over the diverse array of sounds present in natural acoustic environments. It has been suggested that sensory systems might have evolved highly efficient coding strategies to maximize the information conveyed to the brain while minimizing the required energy and neural resources. Here we show that, for natural sounds, the complete acoustic waveform can be represented efficiently with a nonlinear model based on a population spike code. In this model, idealized spikes encode the precise temporal positions and magnitudes of underlying acoustic features. We find that when the features are optimized for coding either natural sounds or speech, they show striking similarities to time-domain cochlear filter estimates, have a frequency-bandwidth dependence similar to that of auditory nerve fibres, and yield significantly greater coding efficiency than conventional signal representations. These results indicate that the auditory code might approach an information theoretic optimum and that the acoustic structure of speech might be adapted to the coding capacity of the mammalian auditory system.},

abstract = {Parsing of sound sources in the auditory environment or 'auditory scene analysis' is a computationally demanding cognitive operation that is likely to be vulnerable to the neurodegenerative process in Alzheimer's disease. However, little information is available concerning auditory scene analysis in Alzheimer's disease. Here we undertook a detailed neuropsychological and neuroanatomical characterization of auditory scene analysis in a cohort of 21 patients with clinically typical Alzheimer's disease versus age-matched healthy control subjects. We designed a novel auditory dual stream paradigm based on synthetic sound sequences to assess two key generic operations in auditory scene analysis (object segregation and grouping) in relation to simpler auditory perceptual, task and general neuropsychological factors. In order to assess neuroanatomical associations of performance on auditory scene analysis tasks, structural brain magnetic resonance imaging data from the patient cohort were analysed using voxel-based morphometry. Compared with healthy controls, patients with Alzheimer's disease had impairments of auditory scene analysis, and segregation and grouping operations were comparably affected. Auditory scene analysis impairments in Alzheimer's disease were not wholly attributable to simple auditory perceptual or task factors; however, the between-group difference relative to healthy controls was attenuated after accounting for non-verbal (visuospatial) working memory capacity. These findings demonstrate that clinically typical Alzheimer's disease is associated with a generic deficit of auditory scene analysis. Neuroanatomical associations of auditory scene analysis performance were identified in posterior cortical areas including the posterior superior temporal lobes and posterior cingulate. This work suggests a basis for understanding a class of clinical symptoms in Alzheimer's disease and for delineating cognitive mechanisms that mediate auditory scene analysis both in health and in neurodegenerative disease.},

Although change blindness resulted in some extrastriate activity, the dorsal activations were clearly absent.

abstract = {In this computational work, we investigated gamma-band synchronization across cortical circuits associated with selective attention. The model explicitly instantiates a reciprocally connected loop of spiking neurons between a sensory-type (area MT) and an executive-type (prefrontal/parietal) cortical circuit (the source area for top-down attentional signaling). Moreover, unlike models in which neurons behave as clock-like oscillators, in our model single-cell firing is highly irregular (close to Poisson), while local field potential exhibits a population rhythm. In this "sparsely synchronized oscillation" regime, the model reproduces and clarifies multiple observations from behaving animals. Top-down attentional inputs have a profound effect on network oscillatory dynamics while only modestly affecting single-neuron spiking statistics. In addition, attentional synchrony modulations are highly selective: interareal neuronal coherence occurs only when there is a close match between the preferred feature of neurons, the attended feature, and the presented stimulus, a prediction that is experimentally testable. When interareal coherence was abolished, attention-induced gain modulations of sensory neurons were slightly reduced. Therefore, our model reconciles the rate and synchronization effects, and suggests that interareal coherence contributes to large-scale neuronal computation in the brain through modest enhancement of rate modulations as well as a pronounced attention-specific enhancement of neural synchrony.},

abstract = {Human cooperation represents a spectacular outlier in the animal world. Unlike other creatures, humans frequently cooperate with genetically unrelated strangers, often in large groups, with people they will never meet again, and when reputation gains are small or absent. Experimental evidence and evolutionary models suggest that strong reciprocity, the behavioral propensity for altruistic punishment and altruistic rewarding, is of key importance for human cooperation. Here, we review both evidence documenting altruistic punishment and altruistic cooperation and recent brain imaging studies that combine the powerful tools of behavioral game theory with neuroimaging techniques. These studies show that mutual cooperation and the punishment of defectors activate reward related neural circuits, suggesting that evolution has endowed humans with proximate mechanisms that render altruistic behavior psychologically rewarding.},

abstract = {The brain is constantly faced with the challenge of organizing acoustic input from multiple sound sources into meaningful auditory objects or perceptual streams. The present study examines the neural bases of auditory stream formation using neuromagnetic and behavioral measures. The stimuli were sequences of alternating pure tones, which can be perceived as either one or two streams. In the first experiment, physical stimulus parameters were varied between values that promoted the perceptual grouping of the tone sequence into one coherent stream and values that promoted its segregation into two streams. In the second experiment, an ambiguous tone sequence produced a bistable percept that switched spontaneously between one- and two-stream percepts. The first experiment demonstrated a strong correlation between listeners' perception and long-latency ({\textgreater}60 ms) activity that likely arises in nonprimary auditory cortex. The second demonstrated a covariation between this activity and listeners' perception in the absence of physical stimulus changes. Overall, the results indicate a tight coupling between auditory cortical activity and streaming perception, suggesting that an explicit representation of auditory streams may be maintained within nonprimary auditory areas.},

abstract = {The ability to detect rare auditory events can be critical for survival. We report here that neurons in cat primary auditory cortex (A1) responded more strongly to a rarely presented sound than to the same sound when it was common. For the rare stimuli, we used both frequency and amplitude deviants. Moreover, some A1 neurons showed hyperacuity for frequency deviants--a frequency resolution one order of magnitude better than receptive field widths in A1. In contrast, auditory thalamic neurons were insensitive to the probability of frequency deviants. These phenomena resulted from stimulus-specific adaptation in A1, which may be a single-neuron correlate of an extensively studied cortical potential--mismatch negativity--that is evoked by rare sounds. Our results thus indicate that A1 neurons, in addition to processing the acoustic features of sounds, may also be involved in sensory memory and novelty detection.},

abstract = {Time-domain analysis of firing-rate data from over 200 fibers from the auditory nerve of cat has been used to estimate the formants of the synthetic-syllable stimuli. Distinct groups of fibers are identified based on intervals between peaks in the fiber firing rates. The large extent of some of these groups--over an octave in terms of characteristic frequency--and the lack of short intervals in the longer-interval groups suggest that the behavior of the nonlinear cochlear filters for these signals is effectively wideband with steep high-frequency cutoffs. The measured intervals within each group are very similar, and correspond to the period of the formant that dominates the group's response. These intervals are used to estimate the dynamic speech formants. The overall formant estimates are better than those of the previous spectral analyses of the neural data, and the details of lower-formant dynamics are tracked more precisely. The direct temporal representation of the formant in contrasted with the diffuse spectral representation, the dependence of spectral peaks on nonformant parameters, and the distortion of the spectrum by rectification. It is concluded that a time-domain analysis of the responses to complex stimuli can be an important addition to frequency-domain analysis for neural data, cochlear models, and machine processing of speech.},

They argue that, on balance, both the neuropsychological and psychophysical data support this distinction. They claim that critical results were either statistically inconclusive (because they consisted of negative evidence) or based on a suspect "calibration" procedure. Finally, they suggest that explanations dismissing the psychophysical evidence for the TVSH are contradicted by the neuropsychological evidence. We disagree with their assessment. 'Negative evidence' is not necessarily inconclusive. Problems raised by mixed evidence are best dealt with by conducting meta-analytical studies, which so far are only in part consistent with the TVSH. Correction ("calibration") of illusion effects is critical for comparisons across stimuli, studies, and tasks. We furthermore argue that both psychophysical and neuropsychological evidence can be explained without assuming divergent pathways for perception and action.},

abstract = {When people experience an unchanging sensory input for a long period of time, their perception tends to switch stochastically and unavoidably between alternative interpretations of the sensation; a phenomenon known as perceptual bi-stability or multi-stability. The huge variability in the experimental data obtained in such paradigms makes it difficult to distinguish typical patterns of behaviour, or to identify differences between switching patterns. Here we propose a new approach to characterising switching behaviour based upon the extraction of transition matrices from the data, which provide a compact representation that is well-understood mathematically. On the basis of this representation we can characterise patterns of perceptual switching, visualise and simulate typical switching patterns, and calculate the likelihood of observing a particular switching pattern. The proposed method can support comparisons between different observers, experimental conditions and even experiments. We demonstrate the insights offered by this approach using examples from our experiments investigating multi-stability in auditory streaming. However, the methodology is generic and thus widely applicable in studies of multi-stability in any domain.},

@article{Humble2012,
abstract = {It has previously been shown that by using spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), neurons can adapt to the beginning of a repeating spatio-temporal firing pattern in their input. In the present work, we demonstrate that this mechanism can be extended to train recognizers for longer spatio-temporal input signals. Using a number of neurons that are mutually connected by plastic synapses and subject to a global winner-takes-all mechanism, chains of neurons can form where each neuron is selective to a different segment of a repeating input pattern, and the neurons are feed-forwardly connected in such a way that both the correct input segment and the firing of the previous neurons are required in order to activate the next neuron in the chain. This is akin to a simple class of finite state automata. We show that nearest-neighbor STDP (where only the pre-synaptic spike most recent to a post-synaptic one is considered) leads to "nearest-neighbor" chains where connections only form between subsequent states in a chain (similar to classic "synfire chains"). In contrast, "all-to-all spike-timing-dependent plasticity" (where all pre- and post-synaptic spike pairs matter) leads to multiple connections that can span several temporal stages in the chain; these connections respect the temporal order of the neurons. It is also demonstrated that previously learnt individual chains can be "stitched together" by repeatedly presenting them in a fixed order. This way longer sequence recognizers can be formed, and potentially also nested structures. Robustness of recognition with respect to speed variations in the input patterns is shown to depend on rise-times of post-synaptic potentials and the membrane noise. It is argued that the memory capacity of the model is high, but could theoretically be increased using sparse codes.},

abstract = {In everyday life we continually need to detect signals against a background of interfering noise (the "cocktail party effect"): a task that is much easier to accomplish using two ears. The binaural masking level difference (BMLD) measures the ability of listeners to use a difference in binaural attributes to segregate sound sources and thus improve their discriminability against interfering noises. By computing the detectability of tones from rate-versus-level functions in the presence of a suprathreshold noise, we previously demonstrated that individual low-frequency delay-sensitive neurons in the inferior colliculus are able to show BMLDs. Here we consider the responses of a population of such neurons when the noise level is held constant (as conventionally in psychophysical paradigms). We have sampled the responses of 121 units in the inferior colliculi of five guinea pigs to identical noise and 500 Hz tones at both ears (NoSo) and to identical noise but with the 500 Hz tone at one ear inverted (NoSpi). The result suggests that the neurons subserving detection of So tones in No (identical noise at the two ears) noise are those neurons with best frequencies (BFs) close to 500 Hz that respond to So tones with an increase in their discharge rate from that attributable to the noise. The detection of the inverted (Spi) signal is also attributable to neurons with BFs close to 500 Hz. However, among these neurons, the presence of the Spi tone was indicated by an increased discharge rate in some neurons and by a decreased discharge rate in others.},

abstract = {We investigated the neural mechanisms underlying the timing procedure that was devised by Libet et al. (1983) to measure the onset of conscious motor intentions in spontaneous actions. We previously showed that, when participants were required to estimate the onset of their intentions using this procedure, the activity in the presupplementary motor area (pre-SMA) was enhanced. Here, we show that when participants were required to estimate the onset of their motor executions (instead of their intentions), the activity in the cingulate motor area was enhanced. Across participants, the degree of this neural enhancement was correlated with the degree of perceptual bias: the higher the degree of enhancement, the earlier the perception. Analysis of data from a previous experiment suggests that the same principle holds true for the relationship between the perceived onset of intentions and the activity in the pre-SMA. We therefore argue that the timing method of Libet et al. (1983) is problematic, because the measuring process affects the neural representations of action and thus also the perceived onsets that the method is designed to measure.},

abstract = {The receptive fields of simple cells in mammalian primary visual cortex can be characterized as being spatially localized, oriented and bandpass (selective to structure at different spatial scales), comparable to the basis functions of wavelet transforms. One approach to understanding such response properties of visual neurons has been to consider their relationship to the statistical structure of natural images in terms of efficient coding. Along these lines, a number of studies have attempted to train unsupervised learning algorithms on natural images in the hope of developing receptive fields with similar properties, but none has succeeded in producing a full set that spans the image space and contains all three of the above properties. Here we investigate the proposal that a coding strategy that maximizes sparseness is sufficient to account for these properties. We show that a learning algorithm that attempts to find sparse linear codes for natural scenes will develop a complete family of localized, oriented, bandpass receptive fields, similar to those found in the primary visual cortex. The resulting sparse image code provides a more efficient representation for later stages of processing because it possesses a higher degree of statistical independence among its outputs.},

We discuss a class of models for human motion mechanisms in which the first stage consists of linear filters that are oriented in space-time and tuned in spatial frequency. The outputs of quadrature pairs of such filters are squared and summed to give a measure of motion energy. These responses are then fed into an opponent stage. Energy models can be built from elements that are consistent with known physiology and psychophysics, and they permit a qualitative understanding of a variety of motion phenomena.},

Using a retrograde tracing technique, we examined what kind of neurons and what percentage of neurons of each type recognized in the CNIC participated in the above-mentioned four projection pathways. We also examined whether the individual CNIC neurons send the collateral to the MGB, the contralateral IC, the CN and the SOC. In the present study, we demonstrated that the neurons participating in the four projections could be morphologically classified into two types of neurons with soma size variation. The percentages of neurons of each type differed among the four projection pathways. Using a double-labeling technique, we found very few double-labeled neurons, indicating the collateral projections to the ipsilateral MGB and the contralateral IC. There were no double-labeled neurons in the collateral projections between the other combinations of targets. Therefore, we conclude that the ascending projection, the commissural projection and the descending projection to these targets arise from separate populations of neurons.},

Although the verbal storage system has been well characterized, the storage capacity of visual working memory has not yet been established for simple, suprathreshold features or for conjunctions of features. Here we demonstrate that it is possible to retain information about only four colours or orientations in visual working memory at one time. However, it is also possible to retain both the colour and the orientation of four objects, indicating that visual working memory stores integrated objects rather than individual features. Indeed, objects defined by a conjunction of four features can be retained in working memory just as well as single-feature objects, allowing sixteen individual features to be retained when distributed across four objects. Thus, the capacity of visual working memory must be understood in terms of integrated objects rather than individual features, which places significant constraints on cognitive and neurobiological models of the temporary storage of visual information.},

@article{Schofield2010,
abstract = {Acetylcholine (ACh) is a neuromodulator that is likely to play a role in plasticity as well as other phenomena at many sites in the auditory system. The auditory cortex receives cholinergic innervation from the basal forebrain, whereas the cochlea receives cholinergic innervation from the superior olivary complex. Much of the remainder of the auditory pathways receives innervation from the pedunculopontine and laterodorsal tegmental nuclei, two nuclei referred to collectively as the pontomesencephalic tegmentum (PMT). The PMT provides the major source of ACh to the auditory thalamus and the midbrain, and is a substantial source (in addition to the superior olivary complex) of ACh in the cochlear nucleus. Individual cholinergic cells in the PMT often have axon branches that innervate multiple auditory nuclei, including nuclei on both sides of the brain as well as nuclei at multiple levels of the auditory system. The auditory cortex has direct axonal projections to the PMT cells, including cholinergic cells that project to the inferior colliculus or cochlear nucleus. The divergent projections of PMT cholinergic cells suggest widespread effects on the auditory pathways. These effects are likely to include plasticity as well as novelty detection, sensory gating, reward behavior, arousal and attention. Descending projections from the forebrain, including the auditory cortex, are likely to provide a high level of cognitive input to these cholinergic effects. Dysfunction associated with the cholinergic system may play a role in disorders such as tinnitus and schizophrenia.},

abstract = {The spatial distribution of neural activity produced by tones was assessed in the rat dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) and inferior colliculus (IC), using the 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) technique. Eight pure tones, spanning the range of reported single unit characteristic frequencies in the rat, were presented at 40 dB above behavioral threshold. The relationship between frequency of stimulation and location of neural activity within each nucleus was evaluated quantitatively. Based on the 2-DG uptake pattern across animals, a tonotopic axis in the transverse plane was defined for each nucleus. This axis transected the centers of regions of evoked 2-DG uptake for each frequency. There was an orderly relationship between stimulus frequency and the location of evoked neural activity along the axis. Each pure tone stimulus activated an approximately equal proportion of this axis, for all frequencies tested, in both the DCN and IC. This suggests the existence of equal 'spatial bandwidths, in rat central auditory structures, across its entire frequency range. Equal spatial bandwidths could facilitate signal analysis strategies which require interaction between neurons with closely-related CFs. In the horizontal plane, however, the proportion of stimulated tissue was not equal across frequency. High-frequency (greater than 8 kHz) tones produced increased neural activity along a much greater extent of the anterior-to-posterior axis of the IC than did low-frequency tones.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

We found that TMS applied over the presupplementary motor area after the execution of a simple spontaneous action shifted the perceived onset of the motor intention backward in time, and shifted the perceived time of action execution forward in time. The size of the effect was similar regardless of whether TMS was applied immediately after the action or 200 msec after. The results of three control studies suggest that this effect is time-limited, specific to modality, and also specific to the anatomical site of stimulation. We conclude that the perceived onset of intention depends, at least in part, on neural activity that takes place after the execution of action. A model, which is based on the mechanism of cue integration under the presence of noise, is offered to explain the results. The implications for the conscious control of spontaneous actions are discussed.},

abstract = {Theories about the functional relevance of consciousness commonly posit that higher order cognitive control functions, such as response inhibition, require consciousness. To test this assertion, the authors designed a masked stop-signal paradigm to examine whether response inhibition could be triggered and initiated by masked stop signals, which inform participants to stop an action they have begun. In 2 experiments, masked stop signals were observed to occasionally result in full response inhibition as well as to yield a slow down in the speed of responses that were not inhibited. The magnitude of this subliminally triggered response time slowing effect correlated with the efficiency measure (stop signal reaction time) of response inhibition across participants. Thus, response inhibition can be triggered unconsciously-more so in individuals who are good inhibitors and under conditions that are associated with efficient response inhibition. These results indicate that in contradiction to common theorizing, inhibitory control processes can operate outside awareness.},

abstract = {The phenomenon of otoacoustic emissions is discussed in relation to the question--is the cochlear travelling wave actively enhanced? Distinctions are made between active loss reduction and true amplification, and between different types of emission source. The dynamic control exercised by the cochlea over the level of mechanical activity is analysed. An adaptive mechanism, capable of oscillatory transient behaviour is found both acoustically and psychophysically in response to strong low frequency stimulation. A feedback model is presented and used to predict aspects of emission behaviour.},

abstract = {According to D. E. Broadbent's (1958) selective filter theory, people do not process unattended stimuli beyond the analysis of basic physical properties. This theory was later rejected on the basis of numerous findings that people identify irrelevant (and supposedly unattended) stimuli. A careful review of this evidence, however, reveals strong reasons to doubt that these irrelevant stimuli were in fact unattended. This review exposed a clear need for new experiments with tight control over the locus of attention. The authors present 5 such experiments using a priming paradigm. When steps were taken to ensure that irrelevant stimuli were not attended, these stimuli produced no priming effects. Hence, the authors found no evidence that unattended stimuli can be identified. The results support a modern version of Broadbent's selective theory, updated to reflect recent research advances.},

abstract = {Sounds provide us with useful information about our environment which complements that provided by other senses, but also poses specific processing problems. How does the auditory system distentangle sounds from different sound sources? And what is it that allows intermittent sound events from the same source to be associated with each other? Here we review findings from a wide range of studies using the auditory streaming paradigm in order to formulate a unified account of the processes underlying auditory perceptual organization. We present new computational modelling results which replicate responses in primary auditory cortex [Fishman, Y.I., Arezzo, J.C., Steinschneider, M., 2004. Auditory stream segregation in monkey auditory cortex: effects of frequency separation, presentation rate, and tone duration. J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 116, 1656-1670; Fishman, Y. I., Reser, D. H., Arezzo, J.C., Steinschneider, M., 2001. Neural correlates of auditory stream segregation in primary auditory cortex of the awake monkey. Hear. Res. 151, 167-187] to tone sequences. We also present the results of a perceptual experiment which confirm the bi-stable nature of auditory streaming, and the proposal that the gradual build-up of streaming may be an artefact of averaging across many subjects [Pressnitzer, D., Hup{\'{e}}, J. M., 2006. Temporal dynamics of auditory and visual bi-stability reveal common principles of perceptual organization. Curr. Biol. 16(13), 1351-1357.]. Finally we argue that in order to account for all of the experimental findings, computational models of auditory stream segregation require four basic processing elements; segregation, predictive modelling, competition and adaptation, and that it is the formation of effective predictive models which allows the system to keep track of different sound sources in a complex auditory environment.},

abstract = {Pitch perception is critical for identifying and segregating auditory objects, especially in the context of music and speech. The perception of pitch is not unique to humans and has been experimentally demonstrated in several animal species. Pitch is the subjective attribute of a sound's fundamental frequency (f(0)) that is determined by both the temporal regularity and average repetition rate of its acoustic waveform. Spectrally dissimilar sounds can have the same pitch if they share a common f(0). Even when the acoustic energy at f(0) is removed ('missing fundamental') the same pitch is still perceived. Despite its importance for hearing, how pitch is represented in the cerebral cortex is unknown. Here we show the existence of neurons in the auditory cortex of marmoset monkeys that respond to both pure tones and missing fundamental harmonic complex sounds with the same f(0), providing a neural correlate for pitch constancy. These pitch-selective neurons are located in a restricted low-frequency cortical region near the anterolateral border of the primary auditory cortex, and is consistent with the location of a pitch-selective area identified in recent imaging studies in humans.},

abstract = {Neurons in area MT (V5) are selective for the direction of visual motion. In addition, many are selective for the motion of complex patterns independent of the orientation of their components, a behavior not seen in earlier visual areas. We show that the responses of MT cells can be captured by a linear-nonlinear model that operates not on the visual stimulus, but on the afferent responses of a population of nonlinear V1 cells. We fit this cascade model to responses of individual MT neurons and show that it robustly predicts the separately measured responses to gratings and plaids. The model captures the full range of pattern motion selectivity found in MT. Cells that signal pattern motion are distinguished by having convergent excitatory input from V1 cells with a wide range of preferred directions, strong motion opponent suppression and a tuned normalization that may reflect suppressive input from the surround of V1 cells.},

These networks allow elegant computations that are thought to represent a number of aspects of brain function. Although there is good reason to believe that the brain displays attractor dynamics, it has proven difficult to test experimentally whether any particular attractor architecture resides in any particular brain circuit. We review models and experimental evidence for three systems in the rat brain that are presumed to be components of the rat's navigational and memory system. Head-direction cells have been modeled as a ring attractor, grid cells as a plane attractor, and place cells both as a plane attractor and as a point attractor. Whereas the models have proven to be extremely useful conceptual tools, the experimental evidence in their favor, although intriguing, is still mostly circumstantial.},

abstract = {Auditory streaming refers to the perceptual parsing of acoustic sequences into "streams", which makes it possible for a listener to follow the sounds from a given source amidst other sounds. Streaming is currently regarded as an important function of the auditory system in both humans and animals, crucial for survival in environments that typically contain multiple sound sources. This article reviews recent findings concerning the possible neural mechanisms behind this perceptual phenomenon at the level of the auditory cortex. The first part is devoted to intra-cortical recordings, which provide insight into the neural "micromechanisms" of auditory streaming in the primary auditory cortex (A1). In the second part, recent results obtained using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) in humans, which suggest a contribution from cortical areas other than A1, are presented. Overall, the findings concur to demonstrate that many important features of sequential streaming can be explained relatively simply based on neural responses in the auditory cortex.},

To investigate whether reverberating activity is important, we studied the temporal structure of local field potential (LFP) activity and spiking from area LIP in two awake macaques during a memory-saccade task. Using spectral analysis, we found spatially tuned elevated power in the gamma band (25-90 Hz) in LFP and spiking activity during the memory period. Spiking and LFP activity were also coherent in the gamma band but not at lower frequencies. Finally, we decoded LFP activity on a single-trial basis and found that LFP activity in parietal cortex discriminated between preferred and anti-preferred direction with approximately the same accuracy as the spike rate and predicted the time of a planned movement with better accuracy than the spike rate. This finding could accelerate the development of a cortical neural prosthesis.},

abstract = {In this review we re-examine the concept of a cortical column in macaque primary visual cortex, and consider to what extent a functionally defined column reflects any sort of anatomical entity that subdivides cortical territory. Functional studies have shown that columns relating to different response properties are mapped in cortex at different spatial scales. We suggest that these properties first emerge in mid-layer 4C through a combination of thalamic afferent inputs and local intracortical circuitry, and are then transferred to other layers in a columnar fashion, via interlaminar relays, where additional processing occurs. However, several properties are not strictly columnar since they do not appear in all cortical layers. In contrast to the functional column, an anatomically based cortical column is defined most clearly in terms of the reciprocal connections it makes, both via intra-areal lateral connections and inter-areal feedback/feedforward pathways. The column boundaries are reinforced by interplay between lateral inhibition spreading beyond the column boundary and disinhibition within the column. The anatomical column acts as a functionally tuned unit and point of information collation from laterally offset regions and feedback pathways. Thalamic inputs provide the high-contrast receptive field sizes of the column's neurons, intra-areal lateral connections provide their low contrast summation field sizes, and feedback pathways provide surround modulation of receptive fields responses.},

@article{Barniv2015,
abstract = {When human subjects hear a sequence of two alternating pure tones, they often perceive it in one of two ways: as one integrated sequence (a single "stream" consisting of the two tones), or as two segregated sequences, one sequence of low tones perceived separately from another sequence of high tones (two "streams"). Perception of this stimulus is thus bistable. Moreover, subjects report on-going switching between the two percepts: unless the frequency separation is large, initial perception tends to be of integration, followed by toggling between integration and segregation phases. The process of stream formation is loosely named "auditory streaming". Auditory streaming is believed to be a manifestation of human ability to analyze an auditory scene, i.e. to attribute portions of the incoming sound sequence to distinct sound generating entities. Previous studies suggested that the durations of the successive integration and segregation phases are statistically independent. This independence plays an important role in current models of bistability. Contrary to this, we show here, by analyzing a large set of data, that subsequent phase durations are positively correlated. To account together for bistability and positive correlation between subsequent durations, we suggest that streaming is a consequence of an evidence accumulation process. Evidence for segregation is accumulated during the integration phase and vice versa; a switch to the opposite percept occurs stochastically based on this evidence. During a long phase, a large amount of evidence for the opposite percept is accumulated, resulting in a long subsequent phase. In contrast, a short phase is followed by another short phase. We implement these concepts using a probabilistic model that shows both bistability and correlations similar to those observed experimentally.},

Stimuli were moving gratings restricted to a pair of peripheral, circular apertures, positioned to the right and to the left of a central fixation point. Subjects were trained to perform a motion discrimination task, attending (without moving their eyes) at any moment to one of the two stimulus apertures. Functional MRI responses were recorded while subjects were cued to alternate their attention between the two apertures. Primary visual cortex responses in each hemisphere modulated with the alternation of the cue; responses were greater when the subject attended to the stimuli in the contralateral hemifield.

abstract = {In many regions of the visual system, the activity of a neuron is normalized by the activity of other neurons in the same region. Here we show that a similar normalization occurs during olfactory processing in the Drosophila antennal lobe. We exploit the orderly anatomy of this circuit to independently manipulate feedforward and lateral input to second-order projection neurons (PNs). Lateral inhibition increases the level of feedforward input needed to drive PNs to saturation, and this normalization scales with the total activity of the olfactory receptor neuron (ORN) population. Increasing total ORN activity also makes PN responses more transient. Strikingly, a model with just two variables (feedforward and total ORN activity) accurately predicts PN odor responses. Finally, we show that discrimination by a linear decoder is facilitated by two complementary transformations: the saturating transformation intrinsic to each processing channel boosts weak signals, while normalization helps equalize responses to different stimuli.},

@article{Tononi2004,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Consciousness poses two main problems. The first is understanding the conditions that determine to what extent a system has conscious experience. For instance, why is our consciousness generated by certain parts of our brain, such as the thalamocortical system, and not by other parts, such as the cerebellum? And why are we conscious during wakefulness and much less so during dreamless sleep? The second problem is understanding the conditions that determine what kind of consciousness a system has. For example, why do specific parts of the brain contribute specific qualities to our conscious experience, such as vision and audition? PRESENTATION OF THE HYPOTHESIS: This paper presents a theory about what consciousness is and how it can be measured. According to the theory, consciousness corresponds to the capacity of a system to integrate information. This claim is motivated by two key phenomenological properties of consciousness: differentiation - the availability of a very large number of conscious experiences; and integration - the unity of each such experience. The theory states that the quantity of consciousness available to a system can be measured as the Phi value of a complex of elements. Phi is the amount of causally effective information that can be integrated across the informational weakest link of a subset of elements. A complex is a subset of elements with Phi{\textgreater}0 that is not part of a subset of higher Phi. The theory also claims that the quality of consciousness is determined by the informational relationships among the elements of a complex, which are specified by the values of effective information among them. Finally, each particular conscious experience is specified by the value, at any given time, of the variables mediating informational interactions among the elements of a complex. TESTING THE HYPOTHESIS: The information integration theory accounts, in a principled manner, for several neurobiological observations concerning consciousness. As shown here, these include the association of consciousness with certain neural systems rather than with others; the fact that neural processes underlying consciousness can influence or be influenced by neural processes that remain unconscious; the reduction of consciousness during dreamless sleep and generalized seizures; and the time requirements on neural interactions that support consciousness. IMPLICATIONS OF THE HYPOTHESIS: The theory entails that consciousness is a fundamental quantity, that it is graded, that it is present in infants and animals, and that it should be possible to build conscious artifacts.},

abstract = {How does the brain orchestrate perceptions, thoughts and actions from the spiking activity of its neurons? Early single-neuron recording research treated spike pattern variability as noise that needed to be averaged out to reveal the brain's representation of invariant input. Another view is that variability of spikes is centrally coordinated and that this brain-generated ensemble pattern in cortical structures is itself a potential source of cognition. Large-scale recordings from neuronal ensembles now offer the opportunity to test these competing theoretical frameworks. Currently, wire and micro-machined silicon electrode arrays can record from large numbers of neurons and monitor local neural circuits at work. Achieving the full potential of massively parallel neuronal recordings, however, will require further development of the neuron-electrode interface, automated and efficient spike-sorting algorithms for effective isolation and identification of single neurons, and new mathematical insights for the analysis of network properties.},

abstract = {We report that multi-stable perception operates in a consistent, dynamical regime, balancing the conflicting goals of stability and sensitivity. When a multi-stable visual display is viewed continuously, its phenomenal appearance reverses spontaneously at irregular intervals. We characterized the perceptual dynamics of individual observers in terms of four statistical measures: the distribution of dominance times (mean and variance) and the novel, subtle dependence on prior history (correlation and time-constant). The dynamics of multi-stable perception is known to reflect several stabilizing and destabilizing factors. Phenomenologically, its main aspects are captured by a simplistic computational model with competition, adaptation, and noise. We identified small parameter volumes ({\~{}}3{\%} of the possible volume) in which the model reproduced both dominance distribution and history-dependence of each observer. For 21 of 24 data sets, the identified volumes clustered tightly ({\~{}}15{\%} of the possible volume), revealing a consistent "operating regime" of multi-stable perception. The "operating regime" turned out to be marginally stable or, equivalently, near the brink of an oscillatory instability. The chance probability of the observed clustering was {\textless}0.02. To understand the functional significance of this empirical "operating regime," we compared it to the theoretical "sweet spot" of the model. We computed this "sweet spot" as the intersection of the parameter volumes in which the model produced stable perceptual outcomes and in which it was sensitive to input modulations. Remarkably, the empirical "operating regime" proved to be largely coextensive with the theoretical "sweet spot." This demonstrated that perceptual dynamics was not merely consistent but also functionally optimized (in that it balances stability with sensitivity). Our results imply that multi-stable perception is not a laboratory curiosity, but reflects a functional optimization of perceptual dynamics for visual inference.},

In the context of memory function, knowledge about the self is typically remembered better than other types of semantic information. But why does this memorial effect emerge? Extending previous research on this topic (see Craik et al., 1999), the present study used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate potential neural substrates of self-referential processing. Participants were imaged while making judgments about trait adjectives under three experimental conditions (self-relevance, other-relevance, or case judgment). Relevance judgments, when compared to case judgments, were accompanied by activation of the left inferior frontal cortex and the anterior cingulate. A separate region of the medial prefrontal cortex was selectively engaged during self-referential processing. Collectively, these findings suggest that self-referential processing is functionally dissociable from other forms of semantic processing within the human brain.},

abstract = {The present study examined whether automaticity, defined here as independence from attentional modulation, is a fundamental principle of the neural systems specialized for processing social signals of environmental threat. Attention was focused on either scenes or faces presented in a single overlapping display. Facial expressions were neutral, fearful, or disgusted. Amygdala responses to facial expressions of fear, a signifier of potential physical attack, were not reduced with reduced attention to faces. In contrast, anterior insular responses to facial expressions of disgust, a signifier of potential physical contamination, were reduced with reduced attention. However, reduced attention enhanced the amygdala response to disgust expressions; this enhanced amygdala response to disgust correlated with the magnitude of attentional reduction in the anterior insular response to disgust. These results suggest that automaticity is not fundamental to the processing of all facial signals of threat, but is unique to amygdala processing of fear. Furthermore, amygdala processing of fear was not entirely automatic, coming at the expense of specificity of response. Amygdala processing is thus specific to fear only during attended processing, when cortical processing is undiminished, and more broadly tuned to threat during unattended processing, when cortical processing is diminished.},

Here significant nonzero serial correlations are reported in series of visual percept durations (to the author's knowledge for the first time accounting for duration impurities caused by reaction time, drift, and incomplete percepts). Serial correlations for perceptual rivalry using structure-from-motion ambiguity were smaller than for binocular rivalry using orthogonal gratings. A spectrum of computational models is considered, and it is concluded that noise in adaptation of percept-related neurons causes the serial correlations.

Perception of two streams during the test was facilitated by small prior Deltaf and by prior perception of two streams and was accompanied by more positive ERPs. The scalp topography of these perception-related changes in ERPs was different from that observed for ERP modulations due to increasing the current Deltaf.

abstract = {Over the past decade, many laboratories have begun to explore brain-computer interface (BCI) technology as a radically new communication option for those with neuromuscular impairments that prevent them from using conventional augmentative communication methods. BCI's provide these users with communication channels that do not depend on peripheral nerves and muscles. This article summarizes the first international meeting devoted to BCI research and development. Current BCI's use electroencephalographic (EEG) activity recorded at the scalp or single-unit activity recorded from within cortex to control cursor movement, select letters or icons, or operate a neuroprosthesis. The central element in each BCI is a translation algorithm that converts electrophysiological input from the user into output that controls external devices. BCI operation depends on effective interaction between two adaptive controllers, the user who encodes his or her commands in the electrophysiological input provided to the BCI, and the BCI which recognizes the commands contained in the input and expresses them in device control. Current BCI's have maximum information transfer rates of 5-25 b/min. Achievement of greater speed and accuracy depends on improvements in signal processing, translation algorithms, and user training. These improvements depend on increased interdisciplinary cooperation between neuroscientists, engineers, computer programmers, psychologists, and rehabilitation specialists, and on adoption and widespread application of objective methods for evaluating alternative methods. The practical use of BCI technology depends on the development of appropriate applications, identification of appropriate user groups, and careful attention to the needs and desires of individual users.

abstract = {Successful social interaction partly depends on appraisal of others from their facial appearance. A critical aspect of this appraisal relates to whether we consider others to be trustworthy. We determined the neural basis for such trustworthiness judgments using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging. Subjects viewed faces and assessed either trustworthiness or age. In a parametric factorial design, trustworthiness ratings were correlated with BOLD signal change to reveal task-independent increased activity in bilateral amygdala and right insula in response to faces judged untrustworthy. Right superior temporal sulcus (STS) showed enhanced signal change during explicit trustworthiness judgments alone. The findings extend a proposed model of social cognition by highlighting a functional dissociation between automatic engagement of amygdala versus intentional engagement of STS in social judgment.},

abstract = {Cocktail parties and other natural auditory environments present organisms with mixtures of sounds. Segregating individual sound sources is thought to require prior knowledge of source properties, yet these presumably cannot be learned unless the sources are segregated first. Here we show that the auditory system can bootstrap its way around this problem by identifying sound sources as repeating patterns embedded in the acoustic input. Due to the presence of competing sounds, source repetition is not explicit in the input to the ear, but it produces temporal regularities that listeners detect and use for segregation. We used a simple generative model to synthesize novel sounds with naturalistic properties. We found that such sounds could be segregated and identified if they occurred more than once across different mixtures, even when the same sounds were impossible to segregate in single mixtures. Sensitivity to the repetition of sound sources can permit their recovery in the absence of other segregation cues or prior knowledge of sounds, and could help solve the cocktail party problem.},

abstract = {The auditory system of the barn owl is an important model for temporal processing on a very fast time scale and for the neural mechanisms and circuitry underlying sound localization. Phase locking has been shown to be the behaviorally relevant temporal code. This study examined the quality and intensity dependence of phase locking in single auditory nerve fibers of the barn owl to define the input to the known brainstem circuit for temporal processing. For direct comparison in the same individuals, recordings were also obtained from the relevant next higher center, the nucleus magnocellularis (NM). Phase locking was regularly seen at sound pressure levels (SPL) below those eliciting an increase in spike rate, thus providing an additional cue for signal detection. The quality of phase locking, expressed as vector strength, decreased with increasing frequency. Auditory nerve fibers showed an unusual step-like decline with a prominent plateau in the mid-frequency range (1.5-3 kHz), indicating that some specialization enables the owl to halt the deterioration and extend phase locking to frequencies up to 10 kHz, above the range commonly observed in other species. Phase locking in the NM was consistently inferior to that of auditory-nerve fibers at frequencies above 1 kHz, suggesting that the synapse plays a limiting role in temporal precision. The response delays, or group delays, derived from the phase-versus-frequency functions of auditory nerve fibers were not consistent with the unusual spatial frequency representation in the owl cochlea. This questions the common assumption that group delays reflect cochlear wave travel times.},

This organization is thought to result from the adaptation of cochlear mechanisms to the animal's auditory environment. Here we report that several basic auditory nerve fiber tuning properties can be accounted for by adapting a population of filter shapes to encode natural sounds efficiently. The form of the code depends on sound class, resembling a Fourier transformation when optimized for animal vocalizations and a wavelet transformation when optimized for non-biological environmental sounds. Only for the combined set does the optimal code follow scaling characteristics of physiological data. These results suggest that auditory nerve fibers encode a broad set of natural sounds in a manner consistent with information theoretic principles.},

abstract = {Selective attention is a fundamental cognitive function that uses top-down signals to orient and prioritize information processing in the brain. Single-cell recordings from behaving monkeys have revealed a number of attention-induced effects on sensory neurons, and have given rise to contrasting viewpoints about the neural underpinning of attentive processing. Moreover, there is evidence that attentional signals originate from the prefrontoparietal working memory network, but precisely how a source area of attention interacts with a sensory system remains unclear. To address these questions, we investigated a biophysically based network model of spiking neurons composed of a reciprocally connected loop of two (sensory and working memory) networks. We found that a wide variety of physiological phenomena induced by selective attention arise naturally in such a system. In particular, our work demonstrates a neural circuit that instantiates the "feature-similarity gain modulation principle," according to which the attentional gain effect on sensory neuronal responses is a graded function of the difference between the attended feature and the preferred feature of the neuron, independent of the stimulus. Furthermore, our model identifies key circuit mechanisms that underlie feature-similarity gain modulation, multiplicative scaling of tuning curve, and biased competition, and provide specific testable predictions. These results offer a synthetic account of the diverse attentional effects, suggesting a canonical neural circuit for feature-based attentional processing in the cortex.},

Taken together, all of the recent work suggests how visual and oculomotor signals are integrated to simultaneously select the visual attributes of targets and the saccades needed to fixate them.},

Therefore, it is important to maximize the hits (true positive rate) during an intended mental task and to minimize the false positive detections in the resting or idling state. EEG data recorded during right/left motor imagery is used to simulate an asynchronous BCI. To optimize the classification results, a refractory period and a dwell time are introduced.},

We also analyse functional neuroimaging studies that explore the neurophysiological substrate of imitation in adults. We marshal evidence that imitation recruits not only shared neural representations between the self and the other but also cortical regions in the parietal cortex that are crucial for distinguishing between the perspective of self and other. Imitation is doubly revealing: it is used by infants to learn about adults, and by scientists to understand the organization and functioning of the brain.},

abstract = {Phosphenes represent a perceptual effect of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or electric stimulation of visual cortical areas. One likely neural basis for the generation of static phosphenes is the primary visual cortex (V1) although evidence is controversial. A peculiar feature of V1 is that it has sparse callosal connections with the exception of a central portion of visual field representation. In contrast, visually responsive cortical areas in the parietal lobe have widespread callosal connections. Thus, interhemispheric transfer (IT) time of off-centre phosphenes should be slower when generated by V1 than by visual parietal areas. To verify this possibility, in Exp. 1 we measured IT of phosphenes generated by TMS applied to V1 and in Exp. 2 we measured IT of phosphenes obtained by TMS applied to posterior parietal cortex. In both experiments, we obtained static bright circular phosphenes appearing in the contralateral hemifield. We measured IT time behaviorally by comparing unimanual simple reaction time to the onset of a phosphene under crossed or uncrossed hemifield-hand condition (Poffenberger paradigm). In keeping with our prediction, we found a substantially longer IT time for V1 than for parietal phosphenes. Additionally, an IT similar to that obtained with V1 stimulation was found when participants were asked to imagine the phosphenes previously experienced during TMS. In conclusion, the present results suggest that IT of phosphenes either generated by V1 TMS or imagined is subserved by slower callosal channels than those of real visual stimuli or parietal phosphenes.},

abstract = {The question of how the human brain represents conceptual knowledge has been debated in many scientific fields. Brain imaging studies have shown that different spatial patterns of neural activation are associated with thinking about different semantic categories of pictures and words (for example, tools, buildings, and animals). We present a computational model that predicts the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) neural activation associated with words for which fMRI data are not yet available. This model is trained with a combination of data from a trillion-word text corpus and observed fMRI data associated with viewing several dozen concrete nouns. Once trained, the model predicts fMRI activation for thousands of other concrete nouns in the text corpus, with highly significant accuracies over the 60 nouns for which we currently have fMRI data.},

abstract = {The human orbitofrontal cortex is an important brain region for the processing of rewards and punishments, which is a prerequisite for the complex and flexible emotional and social behaviour which contributes to the evolutionary success of humans. Yet much remains to be discovered about the functions of this key brain region, and new evidence from functional neuroimaging and clinical neuropsychology is affording new insights into the different functions of the human orbitofrontal cortex. We review the neuroanatomical and neuropsychological literature on the human orbitofrontal cortex, and propose two distinct trends of neural activity based on a meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies. One is a mediolateral distinction, whereby medial orbitofrontal cortex activity is related to monitoring the reward value of many different reinforcers, whereas lateral orbitofrontal cortex activity is related to the evaluation of punishers which may lead to a change in ongoing behaviour. The second is a posterior-anterior distinction with more complex or abstract reinforcers (such as monetary gain and loss) represented more anteriorly in the orbitofrontal cortex than simpler reinforcers such as taste or pain. Finally, we propose new neuroimaging methods for obtaining further evidence on the localisation of function in the human orbitofrontal cortex.},

@article{Bevilacqua1999,
abstract = {Local and superficial near-infrared (NIR) optical-property characterization of turbid biological tissues can be achieved by measurement of spatially resolved diffuse reflectance at small source-detector separations ({\textless}1.4 mm). However, in these conditions the inverse problem, i.e., calculation of localized absorption and the reduced scattering coefficients, is necessarily sensitive to the scattering phase function. This effect can be minimized if a new parameter of the phase function gamma, which depends on the first and the second moments of the phase function, is known. If gamma is unknown, an estimation of this parameter can be obtained by the measurement, but the uncertainty of the absorption coefficient is increased. A spatially resolved reflectance probe employing multiple detector fibers (0.3-1.4 mm from the source) is described. Monte Carlo simulations are used to determine gamma, the reduced scattering and absorption coefficients from reflectance data. Probe performance is assessed by measurements on phantoms, the optical properties of which were measured by other techniques [frequency domain photon migration (FDPM) and spatially resolved transmittance]. Our results show that changes in the absorption coefficient, the reduced scattering coefficient, and gamma can be measured to within +/-0.005 mm(-1), +/-0.05 mm(-1), and +/-0.2, respectively. In vivo measurements performed intraoperatively on a human skull and brain are reported for four NIR wavelengths (674, 811, 849, 956 nm) when the spatially resolved probe and FDPM are used. The spatially resolved probe shows optimum measurement sensitivity in the measurement volume immediately beneath the probe (typically 1 mm(3) in tissues), whereas FDPM typically samples larger regions of tissues. Optical-property values for human skull, white matter, scar tissue, optic nerve, and tumors are reported that show distinct absorption and scattering differences between structures and a dependence on the phase-function parameter gamma.},

@article{Aravanis2007,
abstract = {Neural interface technology has made enormous strides in recent years but stimulating electrodes remain incapable of reliably targeting specific cell types (e.g. excitatory or inhibitory neurons) within neural tissue. This obstacle has major scientific and clinical implications. For example, there is intense debate among physicians, neuroengineers and neuroscientists regarding the relevant cell types recruited during deep brain stimulation (DBS); moreover, many debilitating side effects of DBS likely result from lack of cell-type specificity. We describe here a novel optical neural interface technology that will allow neuroengineers to optically address specific cell types in vivo with millisecond temporal precision. Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2), an algal light-activated ion channel we developed for use in mammals, can give rise to safe, light-driven stimulation of CNS neurons on a timescale of milliseconds. Because ChR2 is genetically targetable, specific populations of neurons even sparsely embedded within intact circuitry can be stimulated with high temporal precision. Here we report the first in vivo behavioral demonstration of a functional optical neural interface (ONI) in intact animals, involving integrated fiberoptic and optogenetic technology. We developed a solid-state laser diode system that can be pulsed with millisecond precision, outputs 20 mW of power at 473 nm, and is coupled to a lightweight, flexible multimode optical fiber, approximately 200 microm in diameter. To capitalize on the unique advantages of this system, we specifically targeted ChR2 to excitatory cells in vivo with the CaMKIIalpha promoter. Under these conditions, the intensity of light exiting the fiber ( approximately 380 mW mm(-2)) was sufficient to drive excitatory neurons in vivo and control motor cortex function with behavioral output in intact rodents. No exogenous chemical cofactor was needed at any point, a crucial finding for in vivo work in large mammals. Achieving modulation of behavior with optical control of neuronal subtypes may give rise to fundamental network-level insights complementary to what electrode methodologies have taught us, and the emerging optogenetic toolkit may find application across a broad range of neuroscience, neuroengineering and clinical questions.},

@article{Cardin2009a,
abstract = {Cortical gamma oscillations (20-80 Hz) predict increases in focused attention, and failure in gamma regulation is a hallmark of neurological and psychiatric disease. Current theory predicts that gamma oscillations are generated by synchronous activity of fast-spiking inhibitory interneurons, with the resulting rhythmic inhibition producing neural ensemble synchrony by generating a narrow window for effective excitation. We causally tested these hypotheses in barrel cortex in vivo by targeting optogenetic manipulation selectively to fast-spiking interneurons. Here we show that light-driven activation of fast-spiking interneurons at varied frequencies (8-200 Hz) selectively amplifies gamma oscillations. In contrast, pyramidal neuron activation amplifies only lower frequency oscillations, a cell-type-specific double dissociation. We found that the timing of a sensory input relative to a gamma cycle determined the amplitude and precision of evoked responses. Our data directly support the fast-spiking-gamma hypothesis and provide the first causal evidence that distinct network activity states can be induced in vivo by cell-type-specific activation.},
