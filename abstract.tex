We investigate the cocktail party problem through an ambiguous auditory stimulus in which the listener undergoes continuous alternations between perceptual organizations. We pair this with neurophysiological modeling, behavioral data, and statistical evaluations to determine what potential mechanisms may underlie the grouping of incoming sound signals into their respective sources.
